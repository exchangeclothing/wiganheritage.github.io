<p>Matters Arising:</p>

  - Joe Taylor to ensure wording proposed by Tom to be passed to the craftsman 
  for the plaque.<br>
  Action before this: Joe to discuss with Fred's family whether they would wish 
  this to happen and how the funds will be made available for the memorial plaque?</p>
<p>Max asked a question regarding what has happened to the plaque for the Wigan 
  Grammar School - comes up every year at grammar school reunion. Action - Philip 
  to chase this issue.</p>
<p>Tom suggested that the network should consider honouring other local celebrities 
  such as Gerard Rickard - painter, etc.</p>
<p>Feedback regarding a proposed name for a road 'Glass House Road' - this was 
  thought to be inappropriate because in army slang it means 'prison'. Max has 
  replied to this effect.</p>
<p>The Cultural Partnership Convention, held at Ince Public Hall went very well 
  and the venue was a good location. Jenny Moriarty (Belfast) was the heritage 
  speaker, members are waiting for a report back on the facilitated work <br>
  Action: John Hesketh to deal with this.</p>
<p>Other issues<br>
  John O'Neil stated that it is important that the heritage network gets involved 
  in BLINT list because it is a crucial part of the Unity Development Plan and 
  therefore gives a measure of position to buildings that are threatened by development.<br>
  Some suggested sites were mentioned:<br>
  Swinly Road and Swinley Lane corner wall (part of old Swinley Hall Estate) - 
  should go on the list.<br>
  Reference to Mabs Cross and Woodfield schools</p>

  is to clean and tidy up Tyldesley Memorial - adjust height of description, floodlight 
  etc. </p>
