<p>Matters Arising: </p>
<p>None</p>
<p>Election of Chair:</p>
<p>It was agreed that, for the time being, Joe Taylor would continue to chair 
  the Heritage Network and act as secretary </p>
<p>Constitution:</p>
<p>As it likely that, some time in the future, the Heritage Network will become 
  a conduit for small grant funds to community organisations, it was agreed that 
  Community Empowerment Network would produce a draft constitution and that this 
  draft would be circulated to members for input and comment prior to it being 
  presented for consideration at the next meeting</p>
<p><br>
  Heritage Network, Cultural Partnership and related matters:</p>
<p>John O'Neill gave a detailed explanation of the Local Strategic Partnership, 
  it's Thematic Partnerships and the how the network of organisations throughout 
  the Borough are linked into this framework. He explained how Council's Vision 
  for the Future paper is running parallel to the Cultural Strategy being developed 
  by L&amp;CT and suggested possible discussion topics to be raised by members 
  attending the Heritage Stakeholders meeting that evening at Robin Park. </p>
<p>Modus, the construction company developing the Grand Arcade, will incorporate 
  a display of the Roman archaeology findings, uncovered during excavations, within 
  the development. A great many shards of Roman pottery were discovered and those 
  that are not required for further analysis should be available for distribution 
  to schools (Emma to investigate what options were for this). </p>
<p>Max Finney and Peter Guy are members of Thematic Partnerships as representatives 
  of the Over 50s and Borough Wide Community Network. Joe Taylor represents Heritage 
  Network on the Cultural Partnership </p>
<p>Ray Hutchinson asked about the role of the Civic Trust relating to Heritage 
  and suggested that they should be contacted and invited to join the Heritage 
  Network (Joe and Emma to action)</p>
