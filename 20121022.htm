<p>A presentation was made to Richard Savill from the Greenheart Partnership Board 
</p>
<p>Announcements:</p>
<p>Carole Tyldesley has retired from Wigan Lesure &amp; Culture Trust after a 
  prolonged injury. The Network wish to express it's thanks for her help and advice 
  and hopes she enjoys her retirement.</p>
<p>The Celebration Evening will be held at the Museum of Wigan Life, starting 
  6.00 on the 1st of November.</p>
<p>Presentation:</p>
<p>Pete Gascoigne introduced Yvonne Web who gave a presentation concerning the 
  New Collections Development Policy, which will go to Council 19th November with 
  written comments to her by 29 October. The Museum of Wigan Life will be applying 
  for the collection to be accredited and part of that process is to explain to 
  our network and the wider public what the collection policy consists of. Yvonne 
  left her contact details and a copy of the PowerPoint presentation will be attached 
  to the minutes when they are circulated.</p>
<p>Mary Pennington asked if the finds that Wigan Archaeology Society has stored 
  are of any interest to the museum. Yvonne said that the borough archaist should 
  be involved</p>
<p>Tony asked about items that the ornithology society have in their possession. 
  She said that the museum would be interested in discussing the matter.</p>
<p>Glenys asked how the public would get to see the various items. Yvonne explained 
  that library space would be unutilized as far as possible, and other venues 
  such as schools, providing security requirements could be met. </p>
<p>George asked about using empty shops fronts and asked where the art that was 
  formerly at Drumcroon House was stored. Peter Gascoigne will inquire. </p>
<p>Minutes of the last meeting: true and accurate</p>
<p>Matters Arising: </p>
<p>There was some further discussion regarding amendments proposed to the Local 
  Development Framework by Central Government concerning land for housing development 
  throughout the borough. Council have indicted to Central Government that they 
  can not consider further areas for development as suggested unless they re-draft 
  the entire Local Development Framework, which will take several years.</p>
<p>Members Reports:</p>
<p>Geoff Jones provided this report regarding Astley Green Colliery: </p>
<p>This week sees the engineering survey carried out of the 100 years old Headgear 
  over No1. Shaft. This is being conducted by outside contractors using a 'cherry 
  picker' and abseiling. The object is twofold. Firstly to provide information 
  as to anything which needs to be done to ensure that the Headgear is safe and 
  has not deteriorated to the point where it can cause problems to our members 
  and the visiting public. Secondly to advise what the full financial and practical 
  extent of work needs to be carried out to restore it to its former glory. The 
  survey has been funded from both English Heritage and local council funding.</p>
<p>Progress in ballasting and levelling the railway extension continues prior 
  to the provision of platforms and two level crossings. Most of the funding for 
  this came from Viridor who have a landfill site on the other side of the canal 
  from us.<br>
  We have suffered another break in but fortunately nothing was stolen due to 
  the alarm system ensuring that the culprit beat a hasty retreat. We caught the 
  person on cctv but as he was fully disguised with hat, mask and gloves the police 
  did not wish to pursue the matter so we ended up with a crime number only!</p>
<p>Restoration of the giant Winding Engine is now almost complete to the point 
  where we should be able to operate it on the first Sunday of every month once 
  the final tweaks have been administered.</p>
<p>Visits by schools and other interested parties continue as well as outreach 
  activities when possible. </p>
<p>Tony Bishop reported that Pennington Flash is infested with mink and the ornithology 
  society is in need of help in this matter. They are going around giving presentations 
  to various local groups and are available on request.</p>
<p>Clair Riley, reported on the success of the Wigan Diggers Festival held September 
  8th and it was decided that E&amp;H Network should explore means of becoming 
  involved in the next Festival, given its exposure and central locality.<br>
  . </p>
<p>Other Business:</p>
<p>John O'Neil thinks we should get a logo designed and various suggestions were 
  made about that.</p>
<p>Date &amp; Times of Next Meetings:</p>
<p>3rd December, 14th January, 25th February, 8th April, 20th May <br>
