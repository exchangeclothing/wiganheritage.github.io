  John O'Neill opened the meeting by welcoming those present noted apologies and 
  made the following announcements:</p>
<p>At the meeting, 19th April, Mark Champion from The Lancs. Wildlife Trust will 
  give a presentation on the development of the Borough's wetlands. The May meeting 
  will include the AGM and will be moved forward to May 24 due to the bank holiday 
  falling on the allotted date.</p>
<p>Mike Mathews Town Centre Manger: spoke briefly about the 10 Town Centres and 
  the three priority Town Centres of Wigan, Ashton and Leigh then concentrated 
  on Wigan Town Centre.</p>
<p>Over recent times the perceived 'town centre' is the 'market place' area whereas 
  it used to be the old market square area. To change this situation requires 
  a link to be established to the Mesnes Park and surrounds. This market place 
  area, the only place in town possible to stage 'events', is experiencing a lot 
  of complex problems at the moment and a team of consultants have been engaged 
  to develop proposals. The problem of vacant shop premises is another worry. 
  The Future Jobs Programme has provided training for up to 15 town rangers but 
  maybe 10 achieving standard is a reasonable expectation, 5 for Wigan, 3 for 
  Leigh and 2 for Ashton. These rangers could make a lot of difference to the 
  town centres by enforcing litter by-laws and providing advise and info to vistors. 
  A new Town Centre Map is being developed and the Environment &amp; Heritage 
  Network is invited to suggest heritage sites that could be included on maps 
  to be displayed in the town.<br>
  Minutes of the last meeting - true and accurate, passed</p>
<p>Matters arising: </p>
<p>A meeting was held on 18th February between Environment &amp; Heritage Network 
  and the Bio-Diversity Partnership to establish a community forum, which would 
  represent member group's views on the development of the Greenheart Regional 
  Park. The proposal was agreed and that the Environment &amp; Heritage Network 
  and the Bio-Diversity Partnership would nominate five members each to this forum. 
  Dave Wilson offered to be one for E&amp;HN. Members are asked to consider his 
  offer and chose the other four at the next meeting. </p>
<p>Concerning the proposed land purchase at Lightshaw Meadows: a meeting was held 
  on the 16th February between the project partners and representatives of local 
  birding groups. A modified scheme was presented and all parties agreed that: 
  this scheme as acceptable and would enhance the area, discussions regarding 
  management would continue and a working group would be established to continue 
  dialogue between interested parties.</p>
<p>The &pound;3000 grant from Awards for All has been allocated to assist seven 
  new groups to start, for webpage training and for equipment. Geoff Jones at 
  Astley Green Colliery Museum is looking after a digital projector purchased 
  for the use of member groups. It is agreed that groups using the projector take 
  responsibility for it whilst it is in their possession. </p>
<p><br>
  The Visit to Haigh Hall:</p>
<p>Over 20 members attended the visit Monday 1st March, taking part in a guided 
  tour of the Hall and the surrounding parkland. Everyone agreed that is was a 
  worthwhile day and already suggestions about the future viability of the Hall 
  and parkland have been received. These were tabled. A discussion regarding the 
  future of Haigh Hall took place and members were requested to email in suggestions 
  so that they can be compiled and forwarded to Stuart Murray, the officer in 
  charge for consideration. <br>
  Members Reports: </p>
<p>Due to the time, it was agreed to skip this agenda item. Member groups were 
  asked to email in such digital reports as they wished to be included in the 
  minutes.</p>
<p>Astley Green Colliery Museum Report.<br>
  <br>
  Contractor Groundwork on the narrow gauge railway Phase 1 extension is almost 
  complete and very soon the hard work for our members will commence. Already 
  many of the sleepers have been prepared and track laying will start. This is 
  no mean feat as each rail is 18 feet long and weighs in at 60 pounds weight 
  per yard. As we can't operate on a single rail, multiply by two! Don't forget 
  the hardwood sleepers either; they weigh in at about 3 stones each. We need 
  8 of those to every track panel. Now where did I leave that Bullworker?<br>
  We should be fitter than butcher's dogs by the time we have laid the first quarter 
  of a mile.<br>
  <br>
  A recent brighter Borough's Grant has enabled two sections of overgrown land 
  to be cleared and landscaped. Thanks go to Cllr. Brendan Bowen for assistance 
  in achieving the grant.<br>
  <br>
  We have asked for estimates from four structural engineering firms to ascertain 
  what needs attention on the mine Headgear as an immediate issue and what is 
  required to preserve and conserve the tower for the next twenty to thirty years. 
  The estimate includes costs for this and also attention to the brick collar 
  that the headgear is located on. <br>
  90% of the survey cost will hopefully be paid for by the local landfill project 
  panel whom, when approached have made favourable encouraging remarks.<br>
  <br>
  The Headgear, like the Winding Engine and its building, is Grade 2 listed and 
  classified by English Heritage as an Ancient Monument, but that guarantees absolutely 
  nothing! The Headgear is also to be listed on English Heritage's Buildings at 
  Risk Register this year. <br>
  <br>
  School visits are increasing in number and frequency and a St. Helens school 
  has visited us twice this year so far. On the first visit the pupils made a 
  film about coal mining and I and two other volunteers have been invited to the 
  premier. No mention has been made yet about any possible Oscar nominations.<br>
  <br>
  Work on restoring the Winding Engine is continuing apace, and a compressed air 
  line has been set up to operate many other display items on site. </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><br>
  Any Other Business:</p>
<p>With the shift towards 'commissioning' as opposed to 'grant funding' as the 
  principal method for third sector organisations to receive operating capitol, 
  the members were asked if their individual organisations were experiencing difficulties 
  when seeking funds. The next round of Heritage Service's Curating in the Community 
  grant funding will be available from April 2010 but there seems to be very little 
  funding opportunities out there for members groups. <br>
  Next Meeting: <br>
  April 19th at Tudor House 10.30 a.m</p>
