Minutes of last meeting - true and accurate <br>
Matters arising - none.<br>
Presentation: Adrian D&#146;Arcy gave a presentation regarding Climate Change 
and the implications for Wigan Borough now that Council have declared a &#145;Climate 
Emergency&#146;.<br>
This presentation was so interesting to the members present, and raised so many 
questions and comments, that it took up almost all the meeting time available.<br>
It was proposed that Adrian and the secretary attempt to arrange a series of meetings 
for various groups and parties interested in the issue, as was suggested at the 
last meeting. John O&#146;Neil voiced his opinion that the relevant officer, Paul 
Barton, should be at those meetings. The secretary agreed to contact Paul Barton 
ASAP.<br>
Should they eventuate, these &#145;Climate&#146; meetings will be separate from 
normal E&amp;H Network meetings. <br>
Members Reports: Not possible due to lack of time. <br>
Mary gave out copies of the latest Archaeology Society newsletters.<br>
Next Meeting - to be arranged
