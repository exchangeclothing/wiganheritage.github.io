<p>Welcome to Brain Parr from Wigan Archaeological Society</p>
<p>Apologies: Jason Kennedy (Conservation Officer)</p>
<p>Minutes of Last Meeting: True and accurate.</p>
<p>Matters Arising:</p>
<p>The 'Tribes of Leigh' project is now called 'Feeling at Home' and is progressing 
  well. </p>
<p>The next All Network meeting will be at Ince Community Centre 20th September 
  starting at 5.00.</p>
<p>The old grammar school plaque that used to be on the wall outside the History 
  Shop is being repaired in Preston</p>
<p>Tom Price has tried to reach Fred Holcroft's wife repeatedly without success 
  so it was decided go ahead with Tom's words for a memorial plaque. Joe will 
  pass them on to the engraver.</p>
<p>Progress with meetings around the Townships:</p>
<p>Borough Wide Community Network have been holding meetings around the Borough 
  with an Heritage them to help identify what Heritage means to residents and 
  to identify people who might help with the updating of the BLINT list. So far, 
  seven of the ten Townships have been covered but two of those will have to be 
  done again due to lack of response at the initial meetings. All the Townships 
  will be covered by the end of the year and then Emma will submit a full report.</p>
<p><br>
  Progress with the DVD and Education:</p>
<p>Zenno gave an update on progress with the funding application. What started 
  out as a comparatively simple project has gown due to the input from schools. 
  John Hesketh, Peter Goodwin Zenno and Joe will meet to sort out the alternatives 
  on September 19. Max Finney will also attend. <br>
  Curating in the Community:<br>
  Heritage Network has opened a bank account so that member organisations that 
  don't have constitutions and bank accounts can use Heritage Network as an agent 
  for funding applications. Tom Price will pass on the bankbook to Peter Taylor 
  so that he can add his signature.<br>
  Several projects were discussed as candidates for the funding L&amp;CT has made 
  available to Heritage Network member organisations.</p>
<p>Tony Hilton and Carole Littler proposed that the Boar War memorial be restored 
  as a tribute to the work Fred Holcroft did for Wigan Borough. Max thinks the 
  original is either in the duck pond or has been taken to a tip. It is unlikely 
  therefore that the original can be renovated so a new casting would have to 
  be done.</p>
<p>Tom Glover and Brain Parr spoke about their project to for an archaeological 
  dig to establish the whereabouts of the Roman Road though Ince. Brain and Joe 
  had taken the GPS co-ordinates of nine locations where the Roman Road is estimated 
  to be from available evidence. Wigan's Planning Department GIS section will 
  be approached to incorporate these GPS co-ordinates into a digital map.</p>
<p>Joe Taylor suggested that Heritage Network could write to all the schools in 
  Wigan telling them about the Heritage DVD now under production, inviting their 
  participation and include a Wigan Accent and a Cultural Vibrancy DVD.</p>
<p>Max Finney spoke about the project that the over 50's have been working on 
  for some time now as is need of further funds.<br>
  Tom Price spoke about the cast iron bridge in Haigh Hall that needs repair. 
  It is quite an involved project. Civil engineers would have to be considered 
  to oversee the whole job because of its immensity and public location. When 
  the civic trust considered the project a few years ago, they found that it was 
  too big an undertaking for amateurs. This is a very necessary repair to the 
  bridge and should have been done long ago. Tom also spoke about the old wooden 
  winding gear from Gauntley Colliery that needs restoration and a permanent home.<br>
  Ray Hutchinson spoke about his vision of developing an interactive type guide 
  service for the visitors who come to see our historic churches, possibly in 
  partnership with the Wigan Pier Theatre Group.</p>
<p>Joe Taylor spoke about Heritage Network undertaking to update the BLINT list 
  for Orrell Billinge Winstanley Township, using GPS, as a pilot project, to establish 
  a social enterprise that could update the BLINT list with GPS for the entire 
  Borough.</p>
<p>Any Other Business:</p>
<p>Glenys McClellan reported that Family History Workshops are held ever Monday 
  afternoon at Leigh Library.</p>
<p>Tom Glover reported that the re-construction of a Roman Bathhouse in the Grand 
  Arcade complex leaves a lot to be desired as far as authenticity is concerned 
  and suggested we take steps to ensure that the Planning Department is made aware 
  of the expertise possessed by Heritage Network so that early consultation on 
  heritage related projects can be facilitated.<br>
  <br>
  Brain Parr spoke about the possibility of procuring some cobles stones so that 
  at some time in the future a replica of the Roman Road might be constructed.</p>
<p>Max Finney was concerned that the one-stop shop, proposed for the site of the 
  Town Hall, might necessitate the demolition of the Town Hall fa&ccedil;ade but 
  as this is a listed building, it is most unlikely that that could happen.</p>
