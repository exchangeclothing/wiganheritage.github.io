Minutes of Encompass meeting held at Ince Community Centre Manchester Road Ince 
Wigan 18th August 2008
<p>Present: Pam Stewart (BWCN), Ed Ellis &amp; Kelly Mills (Youth), Khaled Amini 
  (BEM), Joe Taylor (Heritage)</p>
<p>Apologies: Marion Andrews (BWCN), Carol Watson (BWVC), Irene Yates (Disability), 
</p>
<p>Minutes of the last meeting: The Minutes of the last meeting 7th July 2008 
  were confirmed as correct. </p>
<p>Matters arising: None.</p>
<p>Bank Account &amp; Related Financial Matters: </p>
<p>Kahled Amini expressed a desire to fulfil the role of treasurer for Encompass, 
  as has Irene Yates. Kelly Mills reported on the excellent weekend courses run 
  for this purpose by the University of the North and it was agreed that inquires 
  would be made immediately as to the availability of these courses so that Irene 
  and Khaled can consider attending to obtain certification, as a matter of good 
  practice.</p>
<p>The secretary has made an appointment with the Halifax in Wigan for 9.45 Tuesday 
  26th August so that Irene and Khaled can become additional signatories to the 
  bank account.</p>
<p>The matter of the &pound;4500 and the &pound;8550 allocated to Encompass from 
  the CEP budget was discussed at length. </p>
<p>It was agreed that the &pound;500 allocated to the Over 50s on June 19 was 
  appropriate under the guidance provided by CEP and that Over 50's will now be 
  requested to furnish details as to the purpose for the allocation and to provide 
  receipts for the spend.</p>
<p>It was agreed that Encompass would require a written request for financial 
  support to be sent initially to the secretary, with detailed information on 
  the intended spend, so that Encompass can verify, with the funding authority, 
  if a request for funds fits the criteria under which the funds were originally 
  allocated. It was agreed that receipts, invoices, proof and evidence of spend 
  will be required to fulfil the needs of an audit trail.</p>
<p>ACTION: The chair will write to interested parties regarding the decisions 
  made today about finances. <br>
  <br>
  Report on the Empowerment Consultancy 15th August: Ed reported that six Encompass 
  members were present at that meeting and outlined the outcomes. A great deal 
  was accomplished during an all-day session and the emerging themes will now 
  be worked upon in more detail before the next stage, with the core group, takes 
  place. It was agreed that we will give a full report on the progress of the 
  consultancy to the ASCEND meeting 27th August.</p>
<p>Constitution amendments: A review of the Encompass constitution has been undertaken 
  to seamlessly join the strategic and the operational levels of the organisation 
  and allow access to both levels for individuals and Network representatives. 
  The amendments agreed upon at the last meeting (July 7) were ratified today, 
  as per the constitutional requirements.</p>
<p>A Charter for ASCEND (the operational level) has been prepared over several 
  weeks with input from interested parties. This charter was discussed further 
  and it was agreed that it will be presented for discussion and possible ratification 
  to ASCEND 27th August.</p>
<p>Reports from networks: </p>
<p>Youth Forum Update</p>
<p>Youth Opportunities Fund application forms have now been released, for the 
  current session and are available online via the link online website. Alternatively 
  paper copies are available from CVS and WCVYS. This fund is of real benefit 
  for the empowerment of young people.</p>
<p>Maintenance grant application forms are now available for affiliated groups 
  from WVCYS. Groups that represent young people between the ages of 8 and 25 
  can apply for affiliation, again to WCVYS. 'Its Free'</p>
<p>New youth club at St Pats Rugby League Club, off Darlington St, Wigan. New 
  members welcome.</p>
<p>Krafty Kidz, a youth group centred on traditional crafts, such as stitching 
  and knitting is now up an running in the Poolstock area of Wigan. Although this 
  group has only been running a few months, it already has shown that young people 
  have a great interest in learning these traditional skills (non of which are 
  currently available on the Play-station games machine) I am sure the success 
  of this group will be inspirational to many others and result in more such groups 
  forming all across our borough.</p>
<p>Parents, Youth Workers, Young People or just general members of our communities 
  - we seem to be getting a lot of requests for the basics in this area. If this 
  also applies to you, get in touch with the WCVYS office and join in one of the 
  FREE forthcoming sessions. </p>
<p>Finally Congratulations to all those young people who have just received their 
  A level results; we hope you got what you wanted. Youth Workers, remember this 
  is a time our young people can really need a little extra support and guidance. 
  So, if it is simply a 'Well Done' or signposting to one of the great clearing 
  systems, now is the time.</p>
<p>Heritage Network Update</p>
<p>An initiative to make this Network sustainable for the foreseeable future is 
  expected to eventuate shortly. Should this occur, it is hoped that other Networks 
  will gain confidence and aspire to a similar result.</p>
<p>Assistance was give to the Archaeology Society over the weekend using the GPS 
  skills acquired from recent training undertaken by Heritage Network members. 
</p>
<p>Heritage Network continues to expand and develop. </p>

  of the database if they have any issues.<br>
  <br>
  The date for the AGM is yet to be decided upon</p>
<p>World in Wigan Update</p>
<p>This network now has office premises open 5 days a week and they are looking 
  for funding to secure and sustain their objectives.</p>
