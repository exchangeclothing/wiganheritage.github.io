  Minutes: Helen Smith</p>
<p>1 Minutes of previous meeting</p>
<p>The minutes agreed as being true and accurate. Signed off by Tim Hall 24th 
  April 2007.</p>
<p>2 Matters Arising</p>
<p>It was agreed that the last paragraph of the minutes from the 24 January was 
  relevant to today's meeting and was recorded as follows:- It was agreed that 
  an All Network meeting would be called. At that meeting, the possibility of 
  the termination of Community Empowerment Programme in March 2008 would be discussed 
  to see how the Networks would cope with that situation. The results would be 
  brought back to the next Encompass meeting, for which an effort would be made 
  to ensure full attendance. The Community Empowerment Programme will be on the 
  agenda for the next Wigan Borough Partnership meeting 16th April so that by 
  the next Encompass meeting we should be in a much better position to consider 
  future strategy.</p>
<p>3 Emma's Presentation to Wigan Borough Partnership</p>
<p>The presentation went well and the information provided was well received. 
  The presentation was not about funding but to show the value of the Community 
  Empowerment Programme. It was well supported by Jean Garlick.</p>
<p>Simon explained that Wigan Borough Partnership as an organisation does not 
  have a budget to allocate. The Community Empowerment Programme is just one of 
  several programmes (Neighbourhood Renewal, Children's Fund, etc.) for which 
  funding, totalling &pound;10m+, is coming to an end in March 2008. <br>
  <br>
  There were two other presentations given to the Wigan Borough Partnership, one 
  about the Joint Service Centre and one about Commissioning. The Community Empowerment 
  Programme is now on the agenda but there is still a lot to be done to promote 
  the Community Empowerment Programme and it needs the Network leads to support 
  Emma with this. </p>
<p>Sian Jay commented that Encompass should think about what they do and how they 
  do it. The council and constituent bodies all have to go through major change 
  to be effective and to deliver.</p>
<p>Housing in the borough is an example of how things have turned around in the 
  last 5 years. No longer do they see themselves as gatekeepers hoarding scarce 
  resources, they are now thinking about how best to meet the needs of the people 
  and how best to use their resources.</p>
<p>4 Terms of Reference</p>
<p>It was agreed that the Terms of Reference need updating. Emma has made some 
  suggestions. </p>
<p>After lengthy discussion it was agreed that we need a vision now to take us 
  forward beyond March 2008 and that should the situation change we can revisit 
  it. Sian suggested that the Terms of Reference should not be too specific and 
  should be more of an aspiration document. The revised document should therefore 
  show Encompass's aspirations and establish that Encompass is a valuable organisation. 
  It was agreed that Joe and Carol would form a working committee to re draft 
  the Terms of Reference (in conjunction with Emma) and circulate the revised 
  version for comment before a final draft. Default condition - if not heard from, 
  your response will be taken as being affirmative (agreement by silence). It 
  is important that everyone feeds in his or her comments.</p>
<p>Simon pointed out the need to look at the relationship between the Community 
  Empowerment Programme and the Community Engagement Team and the need to have 
  a formal consultation with the Council for Voluntary Service Board about where 
  the Community Empowerment Programme/Encompass boundaries are. Joe and Carol 
  confirmed that the Terms of Reference working group will liaise with the Council 
  for Voluntary Service Board and the Community Engagement Team. </p>
<p>5 Next Steps</p>
<p>Encompass oversees community involvement and needs to function well. Every 
  organisation needs someone to see that things get done otherwise nothing gets 
  done. Someone needs to take on that responsibility for Encompass. Tim was happy 
  to chair this meeting but unable to assume the role of permanent chairperson. 
  Clare emphasised the need for effective communication. Sian stated that policies 
  and procedures are important and Encompass needs to reflect on why communication 
  is not currently working. There appears to be a lack of communication within 
  individual networks. Joe and Carol will prepare a suggested communication policy 
  for Encompass.</p>
<p>There was a discussion on how community representatives are elected to the 
  Wigan Borough Partnership/Thematic Partnerships. There are currently three from 
  Borough Wide Community Network, one from Faith Network and one from Black, Minority 
  Ethnic Network on the Wigan Borough Partnership. </p>
<p>Simon identified other members of the Wigan Borough Partnership who were able 
  to represent the interests of community groups, eg Over 50's forum. He stated 
  that the nature of Board members is that they are there with a number of different 
  hats on. Carol asked who is on the Wigan Borough Partnership Board and what 
  hats do they wear? Tim recalled that Encompasses original role was to agree 
  the overall policy with regard to the distribution of community grants and that 
  there had been no discussion of a relationship with the Wigan Borough Partnership 
  Board. However, since Encompass appeared now to have evolved into being the 
  custodians of the Community Empowerment Programme, it needed to be in a position 
  to represent the entire programme at the Wigan Borough Partnership.</p>
<p>Joe stated that the Community Empowerment Programme was funded to establish 
  community networks to bring them into the Wigan Borough Partnership. </p>
<p>Tim asked if everyone agreed that Encompass needs to change and be the focal 
  point for the Community Empowerment Programme. Everyone in attendance agreed.</p>
<p>Communication needs to be established between Encompass and the Networks then 
  filtered down.<br>
  <br>
  Andrew said there was a need to be a definite role on how Encompass works with 
  staff in the Community Empowerment Programme. Joe stated that the Community 
  Empowerment Programme needs a contact from Encompass and that we need to update 
  the Terms of Reference, communicate effectively and be the guiding body for 
  the Community Empowerment Programme.</p>
<p>Tim suggested that it was inappropriate that staff members chair meetings and 
  a member of Encompass should be chair. Similarly, all networks should have a 
  chair from the network and appointment representatives to Encompass.</p>
<p>What is the relationship between Encompass and the Community Empowerment Programme? 
  A Service Level Agreement may be needed (it appears to be adhoc at the moment.)</p>
<p>The Working Party needs to discuss with CVS Board what service we need from 
  the Board and what responsibilities Encompass should take. Joe and Carol are 
  to clarify with Emma about the Business Plan and suggest what we put on the 
  next agenda once the Terms of Reference and the Communication Policy are in 
  place.</p>
<p>Thanks were given to Tim Hall for chairing the meeting.</p>
<p>6 Date and time of next meeting </p>
<p>Tuesday 12 June at 10.30 a.m. at Wigan Parish Church.</p>
