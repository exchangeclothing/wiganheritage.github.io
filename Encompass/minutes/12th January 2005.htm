1). Over 50s Forum: There wasa brief discussion around decision making and leaving 
the room after experiences at the previous meeting.<br>
DECISION - It was agreed that no-one should be asked to leave the room whilst 
decisions were made at this or future meetings but that instead people should 
use their common sense, abstain from voting if they felt this to be proper and 
take on an advisory role if talking about their own Networks.<br>
Max, the Chair of the Over 50s Forum and Stuart Murray talked about the Forum. 
(A report was sent to all members prior to the meeting.) The Over 50s Forum sits 
independently, Stuart (Age Concern) and Helen Coffey (Social Services) have provided 
support since it was established 3 years ago. It has worked well. The Committee 
would be unhappy to surrender the independence they feel they have achieved over 
the last 3 years.<br>
Questions were asked about what impact bringing the administration of the Over 
50s Forum under the Community Empowerment Programme banner would have - where 
would it leave Age Concern and Social Services? Dynamics could change, would the 
member of staff be happy with the changing of terms and conditions?<br>
The Over 50s Forum has a Committee and 300 members, it has a good system of contacting 
people and there is a feeling that if administration moved within Community Empowerment 
the worker would be pulled away from the Forum in emergencies.<br>
There was discussion about what would happen if other groups approached Community 
Empowerment for money for admin support. Centralisation could offer benefits - 
synergy provided by CVS.<br>
The Forum is considering long term prospects - it is properly constituted and 
can bid for other resources. Money received via Community Empowerment increases 
the chances of getting external money as it can be used as match funding and shows 
organisational capacity.<br>
Networks have developed differently and have distinct levels of activity. Links 
with older people was a key issue within government guidance. Forum adds value 
to the wider Programme. Is it about commissioning? The Over 50s Forum would be 
happy to produce any reports that were needed.<br>
Options: <br>
1). Keep things as they are <br>
2). Continue the status quo but not indefinitely - put measures in place about 
what is expected in return <br>
3). Pull administration into the Community Empowerment team <br>
All were in agreement that the Over 50s Forum does an excellent job. Some felt 
that the report received covered the Over 50s Forum but did not really give enough 
information about the actual administration.<br>
All felt that boxes needed to be ticked. Could put conditions on giving money 
out and tie work into the delivery plan in a more effective and structured manner. 
After further discussion a vote was taken on option 2. The result was 5 in favour 
and 1 against, with no abstentions. <br>
DECISION - Over 50s Forum granted money for a further year for their Administrator, 
but that conditions are placed on receipt of money. The Governing Body will ask 
for measures to be put in place to ensure progress is made on finding alternative 
funding away from Community Empowerment after 2006. As the responsible body CVS 
will set up means by which progress can be measured.<br>
2). Ice breaker: Went around the room sharing favourite colours. <br>
(There will be a test at the next meeting!!)<br>
3). Any Other Business: A decision was made to carry the other agenda items to 
the next meeting due to time constraints. <br>
4). Date and Time of the Next Meeting: Monday 21 st February 2005 from 12noon 
until 5pm at Leigh Ethnic Centre, 67 Church Street , Leigh..<br>
