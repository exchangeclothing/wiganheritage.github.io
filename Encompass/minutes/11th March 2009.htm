Minutes of Encompass meeting held at The Grange Community Centre Marus Bridge 
11/03/2009
<p>Present: Carol Watson (Chair BWCN), Marion Andrews (BWCN), Irene Yates (Disability), 
  Clare Brennan (Over 50's), Khaled Amini, (BME) &amp; Joe Taylor (Heritage)</p>
<p>Apologies: Pam Stewart (Hon Member), </p>
<p>Minutes: 18.02.09 </p>
<p>True and accurate: Clare/Irene passed</p>
<p>Matters Arising:</p>
<p>Financial training has been arranged for Khaled and Irene on the 25th. Financial 
  training for the treasurers of other networks will be arranged at a later date.</p>
<p>A special meeting relating to financial matters will be arranged for the honorary 
  officers as soon as practical. Clare suggested a savings account might be opened 
  to compliment a checking account but rather than open a general discussion regarding 
  banking matters, the chair requested that any suggestions on this matter be 
  forwarded to the secretary. Irene recommended that we open a checking account 
  with the Royal Bank of Scotland, with an option to make adjustments as required. 
  Marion seconded and the proposal was accepted</p>
<p>Tudor House - Progress Report</p>
<p>Clare had, on behalf of Encompass, thoroughly investigated the various options, 
  costs and terms of contract regarding the instillation of telephone lines and 
  Internet connection at Tudor House. She reported on her findings and answered 
  questions to clarify the many nuances pertaining to these matters. It was agreed 
  that Encompass will be responsible for Internet access only and will not have 
  a telephone line installed. Clare was authorised to take immediate steps to 
  have broadband installed with wireless capability. This utility will be made 
  available to affiliated groups or networks using Tudor House but individual 
  groups or networks will be responsible for their own telephone line arrangements.</p>
<p>It was agreed that Encompass would use Ladbrook for matters pertaining to insurance 
  at Tudor House, after careful investigation by the treasurer. </p>
<p>AOB:</p>
<p>SHIP Event In Atherton 3 June:</p>
<p>Encompass has agreed to pay for a stall at the above event, for networks to 
  use as required. The theme of the event will be traditional costume. Clare asked 
  Khaled if the Kurdish group would attend and if they had any spare costumes 
  for use on the day.</p>
<p>Kurdish New Year Celebration in Bolton,</p>
<p>Khaled informed the meeting that the Kurdish Association is putting on an event 
  in Bolton on the 21st of March to celebrate Noruz, the Zoroastrian New Year 
  and the first day of spring. All members of all networks are all invited to 
  attend. </p>
<p>Next Meeting: To be arranged.<br>
