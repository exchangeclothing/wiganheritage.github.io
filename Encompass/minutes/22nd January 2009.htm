<p>This meeting was called to discuss 2 items <br>
  &middot; the &pound;20,000 grant <br>
  &middot; Premises at Tudor House</p>
<p>Grant monies - The &pound;20,000 has been transferred into the Encompass bank 
  account, which is a savings account. After discussion members felt that the 
  operation of the account would be easier if the monies were to be transferred 
  into a cheque account. In order that the disbursement of the &pound;20,000 is 
  not delayed it was decided to keep the savings account open and as soon as the 
  monies had been paid to the respective networks then transfer the remaining 
  balance over to a cheque account. Joe Taylor, Irene Yates and Khaled Amini are 
  listed as signatories on the existing account. As Irene and Khaled have previously 
  expressed an interest in becoming Treasurer it was proposed (CB) that Irene 
  Yates is appointed Treasurer and Khaled Amini is appointed Vice Treasurer with 
  immediate effect. This was seconded by Pam Stewart and carried unanimously. 
  Cheque signatories on the new cheque account to be Irene Yates (Treasurer); 
  Khaled Amini (Vice Treasurer); Carol Watson (Acting Chair); Clare Brennan (Committee 
  Member). Training for the role as Treasurer to be undertaken asap. The savings 
  passbook was handed to Irene Yates. Carol Watson proposed (seconded by CB) that 
  a sum of &pound;25 be used for 'petty cash' to cover allowable expenses carried 
  unanimously - Irene will action. <br>
  The contract for the Over 50's and BWCN have been handed to Carol.<br>
  Irene's current personal circumstances are such that she is unable to be as 
  active as she has been in working with the Disability Forum (DF) - taking this 
  into account CW proposed that the monies allocated to the Disability Forum remain 
  in the Encompass bank account (ring fenced for the DF) this was seconded by 
  CB and carried unanimously.<br>
  Joe has emailed Carol querying the wording of the contract for the Heritage 
  Network ( so that this will comply with what he presented at the Participatory 
  Budgeting Event on the 26.11.08) - after discussion it was agreed that the terms 
  agreed with Simon Dale and Anne Roberts should apply to all networks and that 
  the fact that both administration and events were covered as eligible expenses 
  means that the current wording on the contract(s) cover all networks.<br>
  Pam Stewart will attend the World in Wigan Network (WIW) meeting on Saturday 
  and discuss and queries in relation to the grant monies and the contract for 
  WIW</p>
<p>Tudor House - World in Wigan have renewed the contract at Swan Meadow Road 
  for another 6 months. Over 50's have already secured a room at Tudor House and 
  are responsible for payment of the rent for this room. Encompass/ASCEND, Disability 
  Forum and BWCN are happy to pilot Tudor House as a base for 6 months. It was 
  agreed that the large room upstairs and the 'shop' downstairs be rented from 
  1.2.09 for a period of 6 months. Clare Brennan to action. Encompass to take 
  responsibility for the rent &pound;1600) with a view to individual networks
