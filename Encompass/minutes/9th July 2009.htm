<p>Minutes of Encompass 'task &amp; finish' meeting held at The Grange 09/07/2009<br>
</p>
<p>Present: Carol Watson (Chair Hon Member), Pam Stewart (Hon Member), Clare Brennan 
  &amp; Elaine Jones (Over 50's), Khaled Amini, (BME) Joe Taylor (Heritage), Phil 
  Hurst BWCN<br>
</p>
<p>This meeting was a response to a decision at the previous meeting (16.06.09) 
  regarding the following agenda item:<br>
  What constitutes a 'community network' and which organisations are therefore 
  eligible to nominate members to Encompass.<br>
</p>
<p>It was agreed that Encompass is a strategic body that aims to act in a transparent, 
  open and professional way, being accountable to both members and partner organisations. 
  Therefore it is appropriate that a criterion for membership is developed for 
  Encompass to adequately fulfil the role required as a full partner within the 
  LSP framework.<br>
</p>
<p>It was agreed that transparency and clarity of purpose were important and that 
  a network should embrace the entire borough. It was pointed out that any organisation, 
  group or individual can attend ASCEND meetings and gain the experience required 
  at strategic level. Should two of more constituted networks be formed, relating 
  to the same issue, it would be Encompass's role to facilitate and enable the 
  groups to reach consensus and develop their own organisations by electing members 
  from each to create a network umbrella group that would serve the needs of all.<br>
</p>
<p>Khaled sought clarification regarding his position within Encompass as the 
  BME representative to the LSP. The constitution sates that elected community 
  representatives to Wigan Borough Partnership &amp; Thematic Partnerships may 
  attend and contribute to Encompass meetings but will not vote.<br>
</p>
<p>It was agreed that for a network to be eligible to have representation on Encompass:<br>
  The governance document (constitution) should be visible online, reflect that 
  the organisation is indeed a network, open to groups and individuals with similar 
  interests, non-political and non-discriminatory (this will inform members of 
  the public what the network sets out to do).<br>
  The minutes of meetings should be visible online to demonstrate that the network 
  is accountable by holding regular meetings attended by representative member 
  groups within the network (this will inform members of the public how the network 
  conducts its business, the decision making processes and who attends meetings).<br>
</p>
<p>Two representatives to Encompass should be elected from each network at an 
  AGM (or an EGM called specifically for that purpose) and the term should be 
  for two years. It was suggested that one representative be elected for one year 
  and the other for two years. This would create a rolling system that will encourage 
  mentoring and skills development for members of Encompass plus ensure both representatives 
  do not leave office at the same time.<br>
</p>
<p>The elected representatives would agree to a role description, (that will be 
  provided by Encompass, and must be discussed with the representative before 
  they agree to put themselves forward). The role description will make it clear 
  that Encompass is the strategic group and only strategic matters relevant to 
  all networks will be discussed at meetings.<br>
</p>
<p>It was suggested that applications for membership should be tabled at the Ascend 
  Group meetings, this will give people an opportunity to support groups and give 
  encouragement where appropriate, plus strengthen the links, but agreement was 
  that, as the strategic and answerable body, Encompass has the final say as to 
  whether or not a network seeking membership fulfils the criterion.<br>
</p>
<p>Reference to the discussion at the previous meeting regarding newly formed 
  networks eligibility to Encompass was noted and reflected upon. New members 
  will have an opportunity to join Encompass as either a co-opted group or developing 
  group but without voting rights.<br>
</p>
<p>Reference was made to the way that other organisations co-opt inexperienced 
  members to the board in a non-voting capacity to gain capacity and to be supported 
  and mentored by more experienced members until such time as they gain the capacity 
  to become full members.<br>
</p>
<p>It was agreed that a full membership and a co-opted membership system would 
  give the degree of flexibility needed. Decisions on the entry level of membership 
  would be Encompass's responsibility. New membership applications would be treated 
  as an agenda item and decisions would be evidence based. </p>
<p>That being the only agenda item, the meeting closed.<br>
