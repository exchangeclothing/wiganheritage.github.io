<p>Presentation by Stuart Murray on Haigh Hall towards a Sustainable Future:</p>
<p>Stuart began his talk by summarising the current position at Haigh Hall, its 
  heritage assets, attractions (the hall, stables, plantations and listed structures) 
  and the 'at risk' register. He outlined where the Trust wants to go with regards 
  to modernising the attractions, securing the heritage assets and becoming more 
  sustainable. Future opportunities include new uses for the Hall, events and 
  activities within the grounds and managing different parts of the grounds in 
  other ways. He explained the 'strategic fit' within the Local Strategic Partnership 
  and the Greenheart Project and Haigh Hall's status as one of the principal parks 
  in the borough. He asked for Network members' views.</p>
<p>It was agreed that we should arrange a time and place for a 'workshop' event 
  and that the Hall would be the best venue.</p>
<p>Action: John O'Neill &amp; Stuart Murray to arrange a 'workshop' event for 
  Network members to discuss Haigh Hall some time in the upcoming year.</p>
<p>Minutes of the last meeting - true and accurate, passed</p>
<p>Matters arising: </p>
<p>The &pound;3000 from Awards for All, to help new groups, was discussed. </p>
<p>Jan Johnson spoke about the Hesketh Meadows Action Group<br>
  Tom Price spoke about the Friends of Wigan Pier Quarter Group <br>
  Brain Parr asked that any funding not yet allocated be given to the Discover 
  Group for equipment.</p>
<p>It was decided that the Hesketh Meadows Action Group and the Discover Group's 
  requests be deferred until the next meeting and that the Friends of Wigan Pier 
  Quarter be allocated &pound;300 start-up money.</p>
<p>Peter Goodwin reported on the conclusion of the Heritage Project DVD and distributed 
  copies of the DVD to members.</p>
<p>The visit to Astley Green Colliery Museum was successful and those attending 
  thoroughly enjoyed the visit </p>
<p>The author of 'The Billingers' held launch events in six libraries, two schools 
  and the local Parish Hall.<br>
  So far the books have been selling well. </p>
<p><br>
  Martin Purcell gave an update on the Greenheart Regional Park:</p>
<p>This is a major project for the borough and will take some fifteen years or 
  more to complete. Martin reported on progress with communication and marketing, 
  describing how the website will go live Monday December 14 (today). A signage 
  audit is planned, as are brochures, leaflets and a short promotional film. A 
  Draft Access Strategy is being developed to connect local communities with the 
  project. Members of E&amp;H Network and the Biodiversity Partnership are invited 
  to a presentation at the Town Hall, 6.00 for 6.30 - 8.30 January 14th.</p>
<p>Concerning the Visitor Facilities:</p>
<p>Haigh Hall and Country Park - a council led workgroup is developing a master 
  plan to look at woodland management, underutilised land and the grade 2 listed 
  Hall.</p>
<p>Haigh Windmill (grade 2 listed) - &pound;50,000 has been allocated towards 
  maintenance as this building is of significant heritage value to the borough.</p>
<p>Pennington Country Park - No progress due to uncertainty regarding the future 
  of the golf course.</p>
<p>The Rushes - A shortfall in funding allocated to the National Coalfield Programme 
  is a major worry. The current master plan is seen to be too golf oriented. Funding 
  for infrastructure and site preparation at Bickershaw South has been approved 
  and has now commenced.</p>
<p>Concern was expressed that if the golf course was scaled down to 9 holes, it 
  might not attract users or competitions. The delay in implementing the golf 
  course also means that the current golf course at Pennington Flash, which it 
  will replace, cannot be converted into extended nature reserve.</p>
<p>Wigan Flashes - Work has started on landscaping and security of land adjacent 
  to the access road into Westwood Park. A funding bid to the 'Setting the Scene 
  of Growth' has been made and a Biffaward submission for habitat management is 
  under consideration.</p>
<p>Amberswood - An outline Local Nature Reserve proposal has been produced to 
  conserve the most important habitats of the site and an application to Natural 
  England has been made for a Higher Level Stewardship grant.</p>
<p>Kirkless - The study area has been extended and the map updated with proposals 
  developed to include Heritage, Wildlife and Community Aspects.</p>
<p>Three Sisters Wetland Reserve - A grasslands action plan is being developed 
  to consider grazing as a means to manage the wetland. Infrastructure, interpretation 
  and stock proof fencing have been included in the Big Lottery Fund 'Communities 
  into Greenheart' bid.</p>
<p>Lightshaw/Arbram Flashes - A bid to acquire and restore 18 hectares, 13 of 
  which are SSSI, at Lightshaw Meadows has been submitted by Red Rose Forest to 
  Heritage Lottery Fund. Community Forests North West has exchanged contracts 
  with the landowner and has 12 months to secure the required funding. The Network 
  has provided an 'in principal' support letter but has informed the funding body 
  that the birding fraternity is opposed to a proposed footpath into the site 
  that could irrecoverable damage the habitat and that the matter needs to resolved. 
</p>
<p>Footbridge over the Leeds &amp; Liverpool Canal - Construction costs developed 
  by British Waterways have been included in the Access to Nature 'Communities 
  into Greenheart' bid.</p>
<p>Link between Wigan Flashes and Pennington - Bamfurlong and Plank Lane - The 
  area from Dover Loch to Bamforlong Bridge is being considered for bridleway 
  and towpath surface upgrading. Rights of Way funding could be available.</p>
<p>Bridgewater Canal Trust - Ramps and towpath improvements from Butts Bridge 
  to Marsland Green will be undertaken with a funding contribution form the Local 
  Transport Plan and a bid to Sustrans for Links to Schools funding</p>
<p>Conservation of Willow Tit - 25K funding has been secured from SITA Trust for 
  work to be undertaken in Low Hall and Wigan Flashes.</p>
<p>Members Reports: <br>
  Members present gave verbal reports about their many and varied activities.<br>
  Ken Barston provided this written report:<br>
  Since the last meeting our Group held its second history night on 23 November 
  which was well attended (over 60 people turned out on a very rainy evening). 
  We had over 100 photographs of Stubshaw Cross on display together with memorabilia 
  of yesteryear (old local glass bottles, children's clogs, clay pipes, tops and 
  whips, piggy game and Edwardian and Victorian ladies dresses etc. Also on laptops 
  we had census data from 1841 and 1881 for anyone to trace their ancestors. Everyone 
  seemed to enjoy the event at Stubshaw Cross Labour Club.</p>
<p>We also now have for sale a calendar of old Stubshaw Cross and a history booklet 
  and DVD of the heritage of our village. The calendar is priced at &pound;3 and 
  the history booklet including DVD is &pound;4. The two can be purchased together 
  for &pound;5. Any group interested in these can buy them in units of 10 at a 
  further discount of 10%. My telephone number is 01942 272605.<br>
  Any Other Business:<br>
  Ann Rampling's group is noting walks in their area of Ashton and asked other 
  members to connect her if they knew about walks that would be suitable for inclusion 
  in a booklet produced by WL&amp;CT<br>
  Next Meeting: <br>
  January 25th at Tudor House 10.30 a.m<br>
