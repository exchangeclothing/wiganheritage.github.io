<p>Minutes of Last Meeting: True and accurate - passed.</p>
<p>Matters Arising:</p>
<p>Leigh Spinners be dealt with in AOB</p>
<p>James Winterbottom explained the current situation regarding the Community 
  Investment Fund:</p>
<p>The next round of funding available will be &pound;2 million. Details will 
  be published via the council website towards the end of June and expressions 
  of interest are to be in by July 30. The application forms will be simplified 
  and there will be more clarity regarding the appropriate size of bids - up to 
  &pound;5000, up to &pound;10,000 and above &pound;10,000.</p>
<p>The themes will target young people and connecting them to already existing 
  infrastructure within the borough; community health and wellbeing, particularly 
  concerning the older population; and a new category targeting the working age 
  population, both in work and out of work. The needs of this age group are coming 
  more under focus as the continuing squeeze on living standards results in increasing 
  debt-related problems, marriage breakdown, gambling, drug abuse and domestic 
  violence.</p>
<p>It is expected that, after the closing date for expressions of interest at 
  the end of July, the smaller applications for up to &pound;5000 will be dealt 
  with quickly. </p>
<p>The larger applications will be notified in around another two weeks as to 
  whether or not the application fulfils the criterion and is of sufficient interest 
  to merit further consideration. For those that pass this stage, further development 
  of the application will be aided throught workshops etc and by the end of September 
  the full application should be in.</p>
<p>Decisions will be made by October and successful applicants will be invited 
  in to discuss more detail and for further negotiation. </p>
<p><br>
  Forward Planning:</p>
<p>Avis circulated copies of the2014/15 Network Action Plan and requested we return 
  them completed at the next meeting. The secretary doesn't have a digital copy 
  for circulation and requested one if anyone else has such a copy</p>
<p>Members Reports:</p>
<p>Astley Green Colliery Museum </p>
<p>Routine jobs continue, the most painful being the annual removal of Japanese 
  Knotweed. This stuff will insist on growing amongst beds of nettles which it 
  is Inadvisable to trip up in! </p>
<p>Progress continues on the railway and hopefully soon we will start to build 
  the platforms for the two stations. We are currently attempting to swop over 
  an engine on one of our diesel locomotives which is suffering from a cracked 
  cylinder block, but sourcing spares, as with all old equipment is proving problematic.</p>
<p>Back on April 6trh, you may have seen Songs of Praise which featured our site 
  as a backdrop to an interview with a man involved when the Golborne Colliery 
  disaster happened 35 years ago.</p>
<p>Visits and outsourcing continue, but unfortunately those of schools seem to 
  have entered a lull. No doubt due to charges made by coach firms. One school 
  told us it cost &pound;300 for a coach from Leigh to Astley.</p>
<p>We have also entered the cruise market, not quite Cunard style, but twice a 
  year a boatyard from Worsley run a trip to us. Some passengers yield to temptation 
  and never get further than the Old Boathouse pub, but others stay the course 
  and we take them around the site.</p>
<p>As stated at the meeting, despite all the twaddle about involving volunteers' 
  support, we still have to fight off certain members of the Council who seem 
  not to want us around. So far Legionnaire's Disease prevention, Rate Relief 
  and annual Overhead Crane surveys have been removed from the council support, 
  with the exception of the latter which is in our lease so is 'in tablets of 
  stone'. United Utilities still continue to treat us an industrial site and charge 
  the earth for water and sewage provisions, which we do not have.</p>
<p>Still visitors seem keen on what they see and what we are trying to achieve 
  so we will continue with our best endeavours. </p>
<p><br>
  ATHERTON HERITAGE</p>
<p>COMMEMERATION OF THE WW1 VISIT TO THE WESTERN FRONT</p>
<p>The Western Front continues to fascinate and appal in equal measures. Names 
  such as Ypres, Somme, Verdun, Compiegne, Chemin des Dames, St. Mihiel Salient 
  and The Vosges. Recently my wife and I made a 1600-mile journey along the Front 
  and surrounding areas from Nieuport, Belgium in the north to Pfeterhouse near 
  the Swiss border in the south.</p>
<p>TALKS<br>
  I have now compiled 14 talks about the period covering events, objects, local 
  people and regiments. Recently these have been given to local societies, community 
  groups and schools</p>
<p>LEIGH FOR ALL<br>
  This event will take place on the 13th September 2013 in the Derby Rooms at 
  the Turnpike Centre at Leigh. It is hoped to put on two displays, local cotton 
  mills and WW1.</p>
<p>&quot;HAVE YOUR CAKE AND EAT IT&quot;<br>
  A charity bake a cake competition to raise money for local Dementia services 
  will be held at Prospect House (side of Town Hall), Atherton on Saturday 6th 
  September 2014, 10am-4pm.</p>
<p>Avis reported on Trust in Leigh; Geoff brought us up to date with progress 
  at Leigh Spinners Mill; John visited Sunshine House, one of the recipients of 
  the last round of funding from the CIF, he informed the meeting about restoration 
  work being undertaken on alter panels at Wigan Parish Church and gave a brief 
  report on the &pound;three-quarter of a million still to be distributed via 
  the Wallgate Development Fund; Glenys informed other members about the meeting 
  June 26 regarding Leigh Spinners Mill; Alex requested a 'Friends of the Museum 
  of Wigan Life' be formed; Richard reported on progress with the WW1 project, 
  the 'In Bloom' initiative and the Dementia project; Mary circulated a written 
  report on the ongoing work of the archaeological society: Joe mentioned the 
  open day celebrations occurring at Greenslate Community Farm June 21st from 
  11.00 until 4.00. </p>
<p>Next Meeting:</p>
<p>July 14th at Greenslate Community Farm starting at 10.00.</p>
