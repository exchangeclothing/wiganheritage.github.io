<p>Announcements: </p>
<p>The chair informed the meeting about:</p>
<p>Heritage Open days from the 9th - 12th of September</p>
<p>Heritage Walks at Astley Green Colliery 19th &amp; 26th of August</p>
<p>The Romans in Town 18th September</p>
<p>The talk by Alan Davies at the Museum of Wigan Life 26th August about mining 
  and art</p>
<p>Part of the Oxford Archaeology Society dig at the Grand Arcade agreement was 
  that the applicant would fund a booklet for schools. But owing to admin problems 
  that has not yet been received. To ensure that it is published. Wigan Archaeology 
  Society have applied for &pound;1500 from the Community Chest to part fund it 
  with the remaining &pound;3.5K guaranteed. </p>
<p>The best person to ring about forthcoming heritage events is Jenifer Roberts 
  on 01942 827663.</p>
<p>Minutes of Last Meeting</p>
<p>Accepted as True &amp; Accurate</p>
<p>Matters Arising:</p>
<p>Tom Price reported on additional venues for the Heritage Open days</p>
<p>The Cultural Partnership Convention, held on the 10th of July, had been a successful 
  event.</p>
<p>There was a short discussion about the PCT being represented on the Greenheart 
  Board. Because Wigan Borough has below average life expectations, which result 
  from health and wellbeing issues, it is important that the PCT, or the body 
  that replaces it, plays a full part in the health benefits that can be introduced 
  into that project.</p>
<p>Greenheart Community Forum Report:</p>
<p>The initial meeting took place 15th July when a draft version of terms of reference 
  was considered. The forum will meet four times per year and minutes of meetings 
  will be displayed on the Greenheart website. </p>
<p>Celebration Evening:</p>
<p>As the Environment &amp; Heritage Network continues to develop, it seems appropriate 
  that we organise a celebration evening, perhaps this coming Spring. The Museum 
  of Wigan Life has been offered as a possible venue. It was agreed that the idea 
  is sound and discussion took place about the form such an evening might take. 
  It was suggested that Peter Goodwin's DVD about Wigan Heritage could be shown, 
  that presentation could be given by member groups, that certificates of membership 
  to the Network could be given out and various other activities to make the evening 
  worthwhile and enjoyable. It was decided that we think about it for the time 
  being and then perhaps a group of people could get together to organise the 
  event.</p>
<p>Other Business:</p>
<p>The secretary reported that at the last LSP Board meeting the lead officers 
  of the four newly formed Thematic Partnerships gave presentations. Three of 
  these Thematic Partnerships have, apparently, no community representation. The 
  Economic, Environment, Culture &amp; Housing Thematic Partnership has, apparently, 
  got community representation only on the Cultural Partnership but these seem 
  to be selected rather than elected. The method whereby community representatives 
  were elected to the LSP and the LSP architecture is now outdated and, as yet, 
  there is nothing in place to remedy this situation. </p>
<p>There was a short discussion about the forthcoming 'cuts'. Wigan has lost &pound;230M 
  worth of investment in new Building Schools for the Future program, council 
  finances are looking at a 25 per cent reduction over the next three years, staff 
  reductions of between 650 and 820 full time equivalent employees over the next 
  three are expected. The coalition government has announced its 'Big Society' 
  plan whereby groups should be able to run post offices, libraries, transport 
  services and shape housing projects. This, it is suggested, will be achieved 
  by giving individuals and communities more control over their local services. 
</p>
<p>As the Environment &amp; Heritage Network is the one of the functioning community 
  networks in the Borough, some thought needs to be given as to how best we can 
  provide support in the face of difficult circumstances. </p>
<p>Zenno Vattev reported that he is still in place as funding officer at WL&amp;CT 
  and willing to help Network members with funding applications.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Presentation:</p>
<p>Garry Harold (Environmental Services) gave and excellent presentation regarding 
  the history of derelict land conversion in the Borough and the emergence of 
  the Greenheart Project. </p>
<p>Next Meeting:</p>
<p>It was agreed that a member group should give a ten-minute presentation at 
  future meetings and that the Discovery Group would do so at the next meeting. 
</p>
<p>Time and date of next meeting - 10.30am Monday 27th September 2010, Tudor House</p>
