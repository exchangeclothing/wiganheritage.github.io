<p> Review of the Network's Position and Future:</p>
<p>The Heritage Network was formed in May 2006 as part of the Community Empowerment 
  Programme, to be part of the Local Strategic Partnership architecture, as mandated 
  by the Local Area Agreement system. Once established, members of the Network 
  were elected to sit on the Culture Thematic Partnership and partake in the governance 
  structure of the Borough on matters pertaining to heritage.</p>
<p>A heritage sub-group of the Cultural Partnership was established and populated 
  by members of the Network. </p>
<p>The Environment Network (ETNA) merged with the Heritage Network October 2008 
  and we became the Environment &amp; Heritage Network.</p>
<p>Since it's inception in 2006, the Network has held meetings on a regular basis, 
  adhered to the terms of its constitution and maintained a website where the 
  minutes of every meeting is displayed for public scrutiny. </p>
<p>The incumbent government has abolished the Local Area Agreement system of governance 
  and there is no longer a mandatory requirement for Council to 'engage' with 
  its electorate.</p>
<p>The incumbent government has slashed the Council's budget and most of the former 
  'community' front- line staff members are no longer in position.</p>
<p>Wigan has a new Chief Executive Officer, Donna Hall, who has inherited a situation 
  in whose history she will have comparatively little knowledge about at present.</p>
<p>The chief officer of CVS has resigned her position.</p>
<p>The Community Empowerment Programme has terminated.</p>
<p>The incumbent government has changed the local governance structure that the 
  Network was formed to be a part of by and the reason, if any, for the Network's 
  continued existence needs to be established. </p>
<p>General Discussion on the Network's Future:</p>
<p>At the end of a lengthy discussion in which everyone present had their say, 
  it was agreed that letters should be sent to the new CEO, Donna Hall and those 
  Cabinet Members with the portfolios relevant ot the Network, asking for meetings 
  with various members of the E&amp;H Network, as appropriate.</p>
<p>It was agreed that Avis, as acting chair and Joe, as secretary, should draft 
  the letters initially and circulate them to members for further input and comment.</p>
<p>Members' reports: </p>
<p>Members who wish for reports to be included in the minutes will send in those 
  reports digitally to the secretary.</p>
