<h1>Wigan Borough Environment &amp; Heritage Network Meeting</h1>
<p>Minutes of the meeting held on Friday 30th November 2007 at Wigan Baths </p>
<p>Present: Keith Douglas (Standish Community Forum), Carol Littler (Orrell History 
  researcher), Tom Price (Civic Trust), Jason Kennedy (Conservation Officer), 
  Tom Glover (Wigan Archaeology Society), Joe Taylor (Billinge History/Heritage 
  Society) and Philip Butler &amp; Zenno Vattev (L&amp;CT)</p>
<p>Apologies: Glenys McClellan &amp; Margery Harrop (Leigh Family History Society), 
  Ray Hutchinson (Wigan Parish Church), Barbara Rhodes (Aspull &amp; Heigh Historical 
  Society), Brain Parr (Wigan Archaeology Society), John Hesketh (L&amp;CT) and 
  Emma Scott (CEP)</p>
<p>Minutes of Last Meeting: True and Accurate</p>
<p>Matters Arising: - none</p>
<p>Reports:</p>
<p>Glenys McClellan has written in to say that the workshops, manned by volunteer 
  from Leigh &amp; District Family History Society on Monday afternoons, are proving 
  to be a success with several inquiries every week. Some people are travelling 
  from as far away as Shropshire to find out how to trace their ancestors in the 
  Wigan &amp; Leigh area. The Leigh Family History Society has been asked to write 
  a report for the next issue of Past Forward and will be working on providing 
  a 'Getting Started Pack' in the New Year.</p>
<p>Jason Kennedy received a letter from the Friends of the Boer War Memorial saying 
  they objected to the memorial being moved from its original position.</p>
<p>Tom Glover reported that the Archaeology Society had conducted a resistivity 
  survey in Mesnes Park and found an indication of where the memorial statue might 
  be. The organisation is concentrating its efforts on the Roman Road, as there 
  is very little evidence of the Roman Occupation or Lancashire. It is thought 
  that Lancashire was under military rule for 300 years and that the roads were 
  primarily for military rather than commercial use. They will be auguring at 
  St Williams School from 9th June 2008 and conducting a resistivity survey 16th 
  June 2008 at Ince Central School. Corner Nook Lane is a valuable historic site 
  that has been granted planning permission for housing development. Jason will 
  look into the possibility of all planning applications being required to have 
  an archaeology clearance.</p>
<p>Tom Price reported that proposed new Abraham Guest School would take away the 
  last remaining section of Clarke's Wagon Road at Kitt Green. This is thought 
  to be one of the first railway lines in the UK to have a steam engine providing 
  the power for moving freight, in this case coal. The engine was known as Blenkinsop's 
  Loco or the Yorkshire Horse.</p>
<p>Curating in the Community:</p>
<p>Three projects underway at the moment with a second phase of funding planned 
  for March next year. These include the above-mentioned dig for the Roman Road 
  in Ince by Wigan Archaeology Society, the poll of Wigan borough's favourite 
  buildings by the Civic Trust and an oral history project by the Foundation for 
  the Integration of Communities in Pemberton.</p>
<p>New Opening Hours for History Shop and Leigh Archives:</p>
<p>Opening hours at both these venues will be increased shortly and a press release 
  has been issued with exact times. There has been a successful Heritage Lottery 
  bid to refurbish the History Shop, work on which is expected to start around 
  September 2008. </p>

<p> Progress with the Heritage DVD Funding Application:</p>
<p>Zenno Vattev, Emma Scott, John Hesketh and Joe Taylor meet and agreed on the 
  content for an 'Awards for All' funding application. It needs two people to 
  sign it off and this will be done ASAP. Joe will sign as chair and Emma as the 
  contact for inquiries. </p>
<p>BLINT list update:</p>
<p>Tom Price, chair of Civic Trust, commented that this is the most important 
  project, as far as heritage is concerned, that has ever happened in the Borough. 
</p>
<p>Jason reported that he is working on the nomination form now and expects that 
  the process will start in January/February. The nomination from will be made 
  available online, via the council website, and will be open for 4-5 months. 
  When the nominations are in, a selection panel will asses them to see if they 
  meet the criteria and the updated BLINT list will be become a supplementary 
  planning document within the Local Development Framework, giving local heritage 
  a degree of protection it has never had before.</p>
<p>This project is being seen as an example of good practice for other councils. 
  We have already been approached by the conservation officer from Knowsley and 
  St Helens Heritage Network are pressing for St Helens planning department to 
  adopt the same policy.</p>
<p>Bill Humphries from the GIS department has offered to come along to a Heritage 
  Network meeting and give members training in using the interactive online nomination 
  from.</p>
<p>It is recognised that the BLINT list update will be an ongoing project and 
  that it will always be open for new nominations.</p>
<p>It could be that a number of conservation areas are proposed as a direct result 
  of the BLINT list update. Copies of the proposed Atherton Conservation Area 
  are available for consultation at the History Shop or online form the council 
  website</p>
<p>GPS Training:</p>
<p>Heritage Network has received a grant of &pound;750 from Bolton Business Ventures 
  towards the total of &pound;881.25 (including VAT) required for specialised 
  training in the use of GPS hardware and software by the Korec Group of Liverpool. 
  Billinge History/Heritage Society has donated a further &pound;150 to cover 
  the deficit. Joe Taylor will undergo the training on January 7th 2008. Heritage 
  Network will then possess the capacity to record the GPS coordinates of nominations 
  to the BLINT list, record all relevant data concerning the nominations, attach 
  digital photos of the nominations to the data, convert the data to GIS format 
  and upload the data to the GIS department.</p>
<p>Heritage Network Representation at Other Forums:</p>
<p>It is still not clear what community representative places will be available 
  on the Wigan Borough Partnership and Thematic Partnerships after an upcoming 
  restructure. A working group has been established to look into this December 
  17 and then take recommendations back to the next WBP meeting.</p>
<p>Due to family matters, Joe Taylor will not be available for some time after 
  Christmas. Tom Price has agreed to chair Heritage Network in Joe's absence. 
  The secretarial duties will need to be addressed at the next meeting.</p>
<p>Tom Price will also continue to represent Heritage Network on our peak body, 
  Encompass.</p>
<p>Dates and Venues for Next Year:</p>
<p>Until such time as the members decide to make other arrangements, Heritage 
  Network will meet every six weeks, alternating between Mondays and Fridays, 
  at the conference room at Wigan Baths. </p>
<p>The next meetings will be therefore Monday 7th Jan then Friday February 22nd 
  at 11 am.<br>
