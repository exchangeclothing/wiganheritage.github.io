  Ordinary Meeting Environment &amp; Heritage Network</p>
<p>Minutes Last Meeting: accepted as true and accurate.</p>
<p>Matters Arising: </p>
<p>The booklet concerning Roman Wigan has been published - copies were distributed 
  to everyone present. </p>
<p>The Network's action plan is being followed as stipulated.</p>
<p>Avis asked about how suggestions for the name of street are made to the relevant 
  council department and how the segments of the Millennium Map had been distributed.</p>
<p>Wigan Parish Church is seeking a HLF grant, which we have supported.</p>
<p>A Heritage Crime seminar will be held in Manchester 26th June at the Cube from 
  5.00 - 7.00. </p>
<p>Network Programme for 2011 - 2012:</p>
<p>It was decided that we would continue with the cycle of six-weekly meetings 
  and in addition arrange visits to other venues around the borough and perhaps, 
  depending on circumstances, hold the meeting as part of the visit. Dam House 
  Astley and Howe Bridge Village were suggested - Richard Sivill offered to make 
  inquiries and report back. A walk around a selected part of Greenheart was another 
  option.</p>
<p>Heritage DVD &amp; Celebration Event:</p>
<p>Peter Goodwin reported that the DVD is almost finalized. It will be 90 minutes 
  long - almost the equivalent of a movie. It was suggested that we should arrange 
  a 'gala evening' at Robin Park Arena, as was the case with the Wigan Dialect 
  DVD, when 100 people, including the Mayor, attended. The appropriate date for 
  such an event would be September. John Hill will make inquiries as to availability 
  of the venue, September 8 being a preferred option. </p>
<p>It was proposed that we have a celebration event at the Museum of Wigan Life 
  in the week starting 21st November to celebrate and acknowledge the achievements 
  of the Network. Rachel will make enquires as to availability.</p>

<p>Astley Green Report</p>
<p>Progress lately has been marred by metal thefts, some idiots actually cutting 
  through potentially live copper cables, as short as 2 feet in length.<br>
  Our generator has been broken into and batteries worth &pound;400, and yet more 
  cable, stolen. This has stopped us turning the Winding Engine until repairs 
  are affected. Other heritage sites throughout the country are also seeing a 
  rash of such occurrences due to the high price of non-ferrous metals.<br>
  To combat the blatant crime, we have had to invest further hard won funds into 
  more cctv cameras and alarm systems, but the rural setting, although scenic 
  permits unseen intrusion of the site.<br>
  We continue to welcome visits from all corners of the globe and local schools. 
  We also support outreach activities throughout the year and our diary is filling 
  fast. St Wilfrid's School are to visit during the activities mentioned in the 
  Stubshaw Cross Report, but our biggest claim to fame is a future visit from 
  Hong Kong University in August. It just goes to show how websites are powerful 
  messengers! <br>
  Laying of the narrow gauge railway is proceeding well, and a spell of good weather 
  has helped in this. <br>
  An English Heritage funding application is being prepared for the structural 
  survey of the mine Headgear. This is following supportive contact with them. 
  Various activities in support of Wigan Heritage Service have and are, taking 
  place including four prospective Family Days in August, which will be on site. 
  <br>
</p>
<p>Atherton Heritage:<br>
</p>
<p>On the 18th May 2011 the Community Group in Howe Bridge held a &quot;Looking 
  after yourself, look after your area&quot; Day. Advice was available on diets 
  and exercise, housing, welfare, safety in the home, crime prevention, recycling, 
  gardening, adoption, the environment and local history.<br>
  <br>
  On the 17th June a one-day conference will be held in Howe Bridge to show how 
  the &quot; Bridgers&quot; Community Group operates, its partners and the events 
  it organises. Walks will be held to show the environmental work undertaken and 
  on local heritage.<br>
  <br>
  On Sunday the 12thJune a plaque will be unveiled to Jim Fletcher, the last of 
  the family to be involved with local Coal Mining industry at St. Michael and 
  All Angels Church. The Fletchers started mining in Atherton in 1770's and Jim 
  died in December 2010.</p>
