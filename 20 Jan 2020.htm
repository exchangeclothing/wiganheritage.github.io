Next meeting had been suggested as a possible visit to Rebel Flower Farm but subsequent 
to the meeting, RFF suggests that March is too early so the next meeting will 
be at the usual venue.<br>
Presentation: Estelle Worthington gave a presentation concerning the work Friends 
of the Earth are doing with Councils and groups throughout the country, in particular 
Greater Manchester, concerning the Nationally declared Climate Emergency.<br>
The members present fed back their opinions, to which Estelle responded, and asked 
questions relevant to the topic, which Estelle answered.<br>
Richard McDonald reported on developments with the Historic Environment Strategy 
and the successful funding bids for King Street and Tyldesley Conservation Area 
.<br>
Julie Clarke updated members on support and funding opportunities available via 
The Deal.<br>
Julie McKeirnan, an essay competition winner, spoke about a essay competition 
for the Leigh branch of the Leeds and Liverpool Canal and requested a letter of 
support and help with judging, which was agreed to.<br>
There followed a discussion regarding the Climate Emergency and the fact that 
E&amp;H Network is predominately attended by representatives from Heritage related 
organisations. It was agreed that the secretary could seek to locate people and 
groups within the Borough, whose prime concern is &#145;environment&#146;, with 
assistance from Council and Friends of the Earth, to determine if there is an 
appetite for separate meetings related to the Climate Emergency or if they would 
like to attend scheduled E&amp;H Network meetings.<br>
Members Reports: <br>
Mary gave out copies of the latest Archaeology Society newsletters.<br>
Next Meeting 2nd March - Discovery Room 10.30.
