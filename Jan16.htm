<p>Members News and Reports:</p>
<p>Peter Fleetwood was welcomed to the meeting. He then spoke at length regarding 
  &#145;Save Wigan&#146;, the work it is doing now and the work it hopes to do 
  in future, in conjunction with other related organisations. The organisation&#146;s 
  website is www.wiganbuildings.co.uk<br>
  <br>
  John O&#146;Neil reported on the presentation event 30th November. The Waterloo 
  Memorial restoration project is well under-way. With luck, the ribbon cutting 
  will occur 18th June, the 200th anniversary of the battle.</p>
<p>Ken Barston successfully applied for &pound;800 from the Community Investment 
  Fund for planters to compliment the community garden. These will be made in 
  conjunction with local schools.</p>
<p>Mary Pennington disseminated the Archaeology Society newsletter for December.Work 
  at Kirkless has now concluded.</p>
<p>Derek Wilde reported that the society&#146;s is continuing its work recording 
  graves, giving talks at various venues on Family History and that the help desk 
  at the Museum of&#145;Wigan Life is now open once a week. </p>
<p>Allan Roberts informed the meeting that the RSPCB now has a volunteer to set 
  up stalls at community events and help spread the message. The society is expanding 
  its remit to cover nature in general.</p>
<p>Peter Goodwin is working on a video for Wigan Youth Service an environmental 
  video on re-cycling for Liverpool.</p>
<p>Tom Price found the presentation given by the planning department regarding 
  Housing Allocation Plan to be somewhat disappointing. Very little relevant information 
  was given out. The Civic Trust have been invited to tour Wigan Hall in the near 
  future.</p>
<p>Neil Forshaw will organise George Formby&#146;s birthday anniversary 26th May.</p>
<p>Lynda Jackson: BBC2 are compiling a three part documentary on Ancient Egypt, 
  the second of which was filmed at the Museum of Wigan Life and will be shown 
  next Monday between 8.00 - 9.00 p.m. The Museum is hosting a number of events 
  in the near future - 26, 27 &amp; 30 January, 16 &amp; 18 May. Free introductory 
  visits to the Museum are available for schools. Items of our Industrial Heritage 
  are currently on display.</p>
<p>Joe Taylor: Greenslate Community Farm are hosting this years Transition Town 
  Re-economy event; details - https://www.eventbrite.com/e/the-road-from-wigan-pier-how-can-we-shape-our-northern-local-economies-tickets-19207996635</p>
<p>Avis Freeman produced a birthday cake and a card signed by members for John 
  O'Neil's 80th birthday. We all appreciate the contribution John has made over 
  the years to both heritage and the environment.</p>
<p>Alex Miller emailed: We have been notified by the HLF that we will have a decision 
  on the First Round bid for the Archives Project at their meeting on 11 March 
  2016. If this is a positive result we will then enter the development stage 
  of the project leading to the full Second Round application.</p>
<p>Glenys McClellan emailed: Our monthly meetings resume on the 19th January at 
  7.30 p.m. with the AGM followed by a talk by Edward Forsythe entitled Crime, 
  Murders &amp; Punishment. Our Help Desk continues each Monday afternoon from 
  1.30 p.m. to 3.30 p.m. at the Archives/Leigh Local Studies Department on the 
  second floor of Leigh Town Hall. There is a lift.</p>
<p>Geoff Jones emailed: As you would expect the current weather conditions have 
  slowed progress down a lot with reduced visitor numbers and the ability to work 
  outside. However brickwork renovation has been completed on No 1 Shaft Collar 
  as well as the access steps to the Engine House. Work has now started on No2 
  Shaft Collar. There have been several operations of the Winding Engine lately 
  but the Gremlins have stepped in on a few occasions. The 103 Years old Engine 
  gives us no trouble but the younger ancillary equipment does. Work on the railway 
  continues and strengthening of the canal banks&nbsp; recently has led to an 
  &#145;inconvenience&#146; cheque and 40 tons load of railway ballast stone being 
  delivered free of charge. An Author&#146;s Day next year ha s been proposed 
  , and maybe something around Halloween too with outside organisation. There 
  are enough ghoulish members to support the latter! . Now that building work 
  has been completed on the new houses we are slowly getting our site back to 
  normal from the contractor, although use of his heavy equipment will be missed.&nbsp; 
  After all 40 tons of stone takes a lot of shovelling.. No doubt when finished 
  we will have some members as fit as butcher&#146;s&nbsp; dogs .A locomotive 
  has been moved to the workshop and is currently having a replacement engine 
  fitted, &nbsp;all done with frozen fingers. This is one of the locomotives we 
  will use when the railway is operational.</p>
<p>Date next meeting: 22nd February 2016</p>
