Encompass (CEP steering group) meeting: 24th January 2007, Sunshine House, Wigan
<p><br>
  Present: Shafa Ullah (BME Network), Tim Hall (Faith Network), Clare Brennan 
  (Over 50's), Joe Taylor (Heritage), Marion Andrews and Carol Watson (BWCN)</p>
<p>In attendance: Emma Scott (CEP Co-ordinator), Simon Dale (Community Engagement 
  Team), </p>
<p>Apologies: Paul Burton and Ann Speers (Disability Forum), Mo Burgess (VSN), 
  Avis Freeman (ETNA), Pam Stewart (BWCN), Nick Trotter and Ruth Walkden (CVS).</p>
<p><br>
  Matters arising (from previous minutes)</p>
<p>In relation to the CEP delivery plan there were some outstanding tasks that 
  Emma had asked for member's thoughts on at the last meeting.</p>
<p>- Rewarding volunteers for their time input<br>
  - How to encourage new members into LSP structures<br>
  - Whether Encompass could provide a consultation vetting approach for distribution 
  of information to the various networks.</p>
<p>Rewarding volunteers for their time input</p>
<p>It was suggested that CEP approach businesses to see what time they could provide 
  for volunteering their staff out to voluntary groups and the Voluntary Sector 
  could reward them for their involvement, which would bring kudos via publicity 
  for the company and good morale for staff as well as helping the community group. 
  Potentially some community centres could have an outpost of a volunteer bureau.</p>
<p>The Council has had discussions with EnCAMS about supporting businesses; Economic 
  Partnership can provide more details.</p>
<p>The past celebration events e.g. Big Thank-You and networking events were very 
  successful because they were held locally and were specifically about recognising 
  people's input and achievements, and were not about consultations or other tasks, 
  etc.</p>
<p>N.B.: Volunteers are still not claiming travel expenses to which they are entitled. 
  There will be a big push by the CEP team around stressing this, and providing 
  claim forms, over the coming month to address this. Mileage expenses could apply 
  to anything that volunteers attended on behalf of the networks, etc. e.g. Partnership 
  Convention. <br>
  If network members are actively involved then consideration should be given 
  by CEP towards reimbursing paper and printer cartridge costs (if the people 
  are doing the work on behalf of the CEP team). Other costs that are in relation 
  to member groups and their activities that are within the spirit of empowerment 
  could be considered on an individual case basis.</p>
<p>It's difficult to reach everyone; however it seems unfair to not give people 
  something back in return for their efforts. It can be perceived that some people 
  do take advantage of claiming expenses, which in turn creates dissent and can 
  reduce credibility of the activity. </p>
<p>Recruit new members in to the LSP structures, </p>
<p>There is definitely a need to do this, to reduce burnout of current members 
  but also to keep challenging the partnership so that it improves (with new points 
  of view). It would be useful to have an organisation chart of the LSP members 
  (as per councillors).</p>
<p>There is a need to re-invigorate CEP membership to make more opportunities 
  for community member involvement in LSP initiatives. The LSP can be difficult 
  to understand to an outsider and needs to be broken down in to elements for 
  new members to understand the LSP role more clearly.<br>
  Emma &amp; Lynn Kay have been working on this and will continue to develop briefings 
  and the LSP guide for representatives.</p>
<p>People need to want to be involved and then to be encouraged to keep engaged, 
  or you could potentially run the risk of disengaging people completely. People 
  need to see results and or things to change quickly (where they are perceived 
  as simple tasks) otherwise there is little point of being involved. There is 
  a need for the LSP to have clearer outcomes and for the public to be able to 
  see the impact of these outcomes.</p>
<p>Consultation vetting service</p>
<p>Encompass was originally proposed as an umbrella for the networks around consultation 
  issues. This is not practical for instances when there is inadequate time for 
  a response, due to the meetings of Encompass being every quarter and/or if there 
  is no response form Encompass members on requests for advice from the CEP staff. 
  As a result CEP staff make a judgement about what should be distributed to which 
  members.</p>
<p>Members agreed that there were plenty of emails that aren't relevant to them. 
  It was suggested there could be the use of a contact management service or a 
  simple database that allows CEP to filter e-mail but this does need people to 
  sign-up to be willing to have their contact details shared.</p>
<p>CEP Position Paper</p>
<p>The long-term existence of the CEP isn't certain, as the programme has not 
  yet secured funding for post March 2008. There could be funding available from 
  the Wigan Borough Partnership, but this is by no means certain.</p>
<p>CEP's role is about getting people engaged in the decision-making processes 
  in the borough. The Networks have their independence now but they are not always 
  effective in what they do and their cost-effectiveness has been questioned. 
  The original guidance from Government Offices was very unhelpful by suggesting 
  that no engagement should be made with elected members, etc. This was actually 
  written into the BWCN constitution and has caused some ill feeling towards the 
  networks in the past.</p>
<p>Members felt that CEP needed to concentrate on achieving a small range of relevant 
  issues effectively, rather than trying to do a whole host of work that is not 
  done well. E.g. Perhaps CEP should only support the more vulnerable groups such 
  as BME, Travellers, Disabled etc.</p>
<p>Joe felt there was a need for increased effectiveness of the programme overall 
  and that this would require a change in people's input into making things happen 
  so that the networks were considered affective.<br>
  The theory is that anyone in the community can get their issue raised from the 
  grass roots via the networks and townships, then onto Thematic Partnerships 
  and ultimately the WBP Board. Currently community reps on the Townships, Thematic 
  Partnerships and Networks all feed into the LSP separately, usually without 
  reference to each other.</p>
<p>An option Joe suggested was that the programme team could be situated with 
  the Community Engagement Team, which would enable access to much more information 
  and enable the affecting of change more easily. The programme would need a strong 
  management group to guide the activities so that other requirements of the CE 
  team did not divert attention from the main task of community empowerment.</p>
<p>The Council's Community Engagement Team is having concerns about whether they 
  should do 'involvement' work at all and is struggling with getting some partners 
  to invest in certain activities/LSP business. </p>
<p>Another option is to take CEP outside of being managed by CVS and for it to 
  become a totally independent group. This would require a management committee 
  to be formed and possibly a Company Limited by Guarantee, so that they could 
  employ staff to help run the required activities.</p>
<p>Members came to the conclusion that there is a different set-up for the networks 
  now and that some people were just new members, etc. so it was difficult to 
  get a general feeling from those present at this meeting. </p>
<p>Action: All network leads to provide a few ideas on how they would like to 
  see the networks operating after March 2008 to ascertain what are the priority 
  needs for each network.</p>
<p>Action: Need to consider setting up a sub-group to look at viable options for 
  the networks to continue after March 2008. What are the administration and development 
  needs of the networks? The requirements then need to be calculated as an actual 
  cost and then a plan developed on how it all can be delivered.</p>
<p>Question: What about having the community representatives based in the Council/Community 
  Engagement Team? It was considered potentially difficult to have paid people 
  working alongside volunteers doing the same level of work.</p>
<p>Over 50's Forum has managed to become independent from CEP. The group has secured 
  funding for an administration officer, however this is not permanently funded.</p>
<p>Action: Need to contact all the major partners of the LSP to let them know 
  they can achieve their aims through the Networks. CEP team can be their access 
  to 'grass roots' and that CEP team can feedback information to them about what 
  communities want.</p>
<p>Borough Life has a wide distribution creating an opportunity to engage with 
  'unusual suspects'. Having community involvement is a good thing, even if changes 
  aren't made overnight.<br>
  The Council and Community Engagement Team are very supportive of the CEP.</p>
<p>After this general discussion it was agreed that an All Network meeting would 
  be called. At that meeting, the possibility of the termination of CEP in March 
  2008 would be discussed to see how the Networks would cope with that situation. 
  The results would be brought back to the next Encompass meeting, for which an 
  effort would be made to ensure full attendance. CEP will be on the agenda for 
  the next LSP meeting 16th April so that by the next Encompass meeting we should 
  be in a much better position to consider future strategy. <br>
  <br>
  Date and time of next meeting</p>
<p>10am 24th April 2007, meet at Coops building entrance, meeting to be held at 
  Bluecoats School building, next to Wigan Parish Church.<br>
