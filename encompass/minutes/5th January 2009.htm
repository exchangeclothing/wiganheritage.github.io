Minutes of Encompass meeting held at The Grange Community Centre Marus Bridge 
05/01/2009
<p>Present: Pam Stewart &amp; Carol Watson (BWCN), Khaled Amini &amp; Sullyman 
  Mohammed (BME), Clare Brennan (Over 50's), Joe Taylor (Heritage)</p>
<p>Apologies: Marion Andrews (BWCN), Irene Yates (Disability)</p>
<p>Bank Account &amp; Related Financial Matters:</p>
<p>A complete Excel record of all financial transactions, since the Encompass 
  bank account was opened 23 Oct 2007, was presented and scrutinised in detail. 
  Receipts have been obtained for all expenditure except the cheque paid Nov 2007 
  to Wigan District Community Transport for transport to the Community North West 
  conference in Kendal. This will be obtained ASAP.</p>
<p>It was decided that members attending Encompass meetings and using their cars 
  for transport are entitled to 40 pence per mile from April 2008. Those members 
  wishing to claim expenses should forward their detailed expense claims for ratification, 
  at their earliest convenience. It was also decided that The Grange Community 
  Centre might claim for the use of premises for meetings.</p>
<p>Prior to the meeting the &pound;20,000 allocation from the LSP had not been 
  transferred to the Encompass account: after the meeting it was discovered that 
  this was, in fact, the case. Anne Roberts has been off sick and this had caused 
  some delay. Anne was also helping to draft an agreement between Encompass and 
  those recipients awarded funding at the Participatory Budgeting event with regards 
  to conditions of use and accountability. Carol will make inquires tomorrow (6th 
  Jan) re progress with this document and report back.</p>
<p>As the secretary will not be available for two weeks, the bankbook will be 
  deposited in the safe at The Grange so that Khaled can collect it as necessary. 
  Irene Yates is also a signatory to the account. </p>
<p>The secretary intends taking accounting training with St Helens CVS and it 
  was decided that he should continue his role as acting treasurer until such 
  time as another member gains a relevant accreditation and offers to take over 
  the role.</p>
<p>Office Space - yes no or maybe:</p>
<p>Marion and Phil had previously identified office space at Tudor House that 
  they considered to be suitable for Encompass and/or the Networks. Over 50's 
  have taken space at Tudor House and BWCN are holding a meeting there Jan 7th. 
  World in Wigan have decided to remain where there are for the time being. </p>
<p>After discussion is was unanimously agreed that Encompass will seek to lease 
  space at Tudor House for six months and that Clare Brennan is delegated to take 
  care of these negotiations on behalf of Encompass, keeping in touch with members 
  as she does so. </p>
<p>The Next Ascend Meeting at the Town Hall: </p>
<p>Pam Stewart spoke about the rapid and productive progress made since the end 
  of the CEP program and the break with CVS. Encompass is now a recognised entity 
  in the Borough. </p>
<p>A concern is that we are losing long-established, respected community identities 
  such as Eileen Waldron and having difficulty finding replacements. It is therefore 
  important that we make a determined effort to bring new people into the local 
  governance process and into Encompass.</p>
<p>Due in part to government directives regarding community involvement, the community 
  networking consultancy, the developing community networking strategy and other 
  changed circumstances, including funding, we are now at the beginning of a new 
  era regarding the relationship between the community, the LSP and the delivery 
  of services within the Borough. The next Ascend meeting will be a very important 
  step in the building of that new relationship. After much constructive discussion 
  it was decided that the secretary is delegated to arrange the next Ascend meeting 
  in conjunction with the LSP chief officer and to keep the Chair and other members 
  informed at all stages.</p>
<p>The Website:</p>
<p>A website is currently being developed for Encompass. Progress to that date 
  was displayed at the last Community Networking Strategy meeting. Several people 
  have since made contributions and suggested modifications have been made. Sian 
  Jay has indicated that she approves of the site and inquired as to a marketing 
  strategy for it. Clare Brennan and Khaled Amini have webpage design capacity 
  and both approve of the site. Joe will teach Khaled how to update the site, 
  when convenient. Joe affirmed the need to bring more local residents into the 
  local governance process, as outlined under the 'Get In Touch' tab of the site 
  http://www.enwal.org/index.php?page=get-in-touch (inspired by the Vision 2026 
  Community Strategy). Clare emphasised the need for a good marketing strategy 
  for the site and the work that Encompass is now doing. Joe indicated that he 
  thought to incorporate the launch of the site into the marketing strategy that 
  will be developed for the next Ascend meeting. </p>
<p>Minutes of the last meeting: </p>
<p>The minutes of the previous meeting were accepted as true and accurate. There 
  were no matters arising.</p>
<p>AOB</p>
<p>Marion had emailed the chair to suggest a discussion regarding Regenerate Trust. 
  Pam Stewart informed the meeting that thee people present, herself, Khaled Amini 
  and Clare Brennan, were closely involved with Pulse and Regenerate Trust. It 
  was therefore ruled that discussion on this topic was not appropriate.</p>
<p>Pam informed the meeting that she has been asked to chair the next 'Building 
  Schools For The Future' national conference, at which four government ministers 
  will be in attendance. <br>
