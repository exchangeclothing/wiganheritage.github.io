<p></p>
<p>Matters Arising</p>
<p>Consultancy (Regenerate) - Paul Halfpenny network of potential social enterprises. 
  ID and mapping work to be done.</p>
<p>Wigan Borough doesn't do so well at start-ups, but can support current businesses 
  (only 2 development trusts) 8 projects have been funded with worklessness/incapacity 
  benefit issues being tackled.</p>
<p>Potential for SE's at various locations of community buildings, e.g. Higher 
  Fold new kitchen.</p>
<p>Networks Update</p>
<p>BME<br>
  Peter's work-based project research to find out why BME people are not engaging. 
  Action plan by April 2007.</p>
<p>Disability<br>
  Plan to do another Do Youth Know Day (this was a turning point for the network) 
  committed group of 12, 96 members.</p>
<p>Faith<br>
  Wigan getting involved in projects. <br>
  &middot; Sure Start/children's centre and care for the family - good parenting.<br>
  &middot; Health advice e.g. drug proof your kids via organisations - schools.<br>
  &middot; Multi-faith chaplaincy at Wigan campus of college.</p>
<p>Leigh Involved in potential for similar multi-faith chaplaincy at Leigh Sports 
  Village.</p>
<p>Ashton &amp; Bryn not interested in getting involved in township forum (possibility 
  of involvement via youth to model Hindley's success).<br>
  Shevington asked to formally disband their network. Issues through Parish Council.</p>
<p>Lowton facilities and clearer understanding of role at township.</p>
<p>Atherton links with individuals to BME Network and drop-in idea.</p>
<p>Inter-faith possible events for Wigan and Leigh.</p>
<p>Questions</p>
<p>Disability and ETNA both have individual members. How do we let people know 
  that they can join as individuals (each network has own TOR).</p>
<p>Disability Forum publicity not getting to the right places? Libraries and local 
  press have been covered.</p>
<p>Might need to make some serious decisions about membership and CEP's role should 
  be to help individuals join appropriate groups or form new ones. Too many individuals 
  - unworkable forum.</p>
<p>Warrington model is good, however, Wigan Borough needs to get used to having 
  people on campaign trail. Salford model also good - training for taxi ??????????????? 
  Some organisations refuse to work together e.g. there are 23 stroke groups in 
  the borough, deaf groups won't work together.</p>
<p>Andrew asked Simon if there was a lead officer in the council for disability 
  (separate to diversity/equality). <br>
  Susan Lowe is a Solicitor that deals with facilities.<br>
  Martin Kimber deals with specific planning. <br>
  Bernard Walker leads on equality and diversity.<br>
  Senior Level Strategy Group held on the last Thursday of every month.<br>
  Diversity Champions for equality and diversity package - to check it out.</p>
<p>Encompass would like to know who should be the lead officer at WMBC for disability 
  issues (in relation to DDA and disability forum). Action : Simon Dale.</p>
<p>ETNA - wide variety of groups represented. Environment and Transport issues. 
  Bickershaw Development has lots of partnerships involved and will affect a lot 
  of people. Consultation has been a bit hit and miss so far and perhaps distorted 
  thus being done mainly in schools. EP and WMBC have agreed to do more consultation.</p>
<p>VSN - hot topic is commissioning with the community/voluntary sector. Both 
  Nick and Emma have had the same experience of struggling to find appropriate 
  person to explain and help voluntary/community sector understand commissioning 
  and capacity build.</p>
<p>Fundamental issues within the 'health family' engaging around issues of townships 
  and only want to talk to people when they have a ?????????</p>
<p>BWCN - e.g. clinical governance!! Reviewed membership - more realistic view 
  of this. AGM on the 2nd October there will be a re-election of representatives 
  and then need to look at the world through non rose-tinted glasses.</p>
<p>Over 50's - supposed to be township based, but feel isn't. Would like some 
  feedback from forums on what developments have occurred and report back to forum. 
  Clare to ask Sian which of Over 50's forum members are on townships (website). 
  Moving towards more independent from SS and becoming more professional as an 
  organisation and possible as a lobbying group (registered charity).</p>
<p>Also 4 sub groups: social, roadshows, finance, intergeneration looking at membership 
  and other activities for forum that are non-traditional.</p>
<p>Heritage not very good on promoting our past, knowledge is not collected although 
  it is out there. Clare - contacts with information on Wigan &amp; Leigh Irish 
  from where.</p>
<p>Ned to work out which networks are self-sustaining and which are 'artificial' 
  structures that CEP keeps going. Need to do a paper on how the networks want 
  to look like in March 2008. - WBP Board to help them make a financial decision.</p>
<p>Mentor pack and information</p>
<p>BWCN for new members/representatives and improve involvement in LSP.</p>
<p>Need to piggyback on activities in NRF areas, so can not distract people from 
  main goals (offer assistance as we go along).</p>
<p>Over 50's Forum wants to develop a strategic plan - could be offered across 
  WBP (as part of learning plan). Use better language in those and ensure everyone 
  in organisation is involved in owning the aims.</p>
<p>CVS can tailor for needs of sector. ES to talk to Clare B re requests of over 
  50's training needs.</p>
<p>Date and time of next meeting</p>
