Minutes of Encompass meeting held at The Grange Community Centre Marus Bridge 
02/02/2009
<p>Present: Carol Watson (Chair) &amp; Marion Andrews (BWCN), Irene Yates (Disability), 
  Khaled Amini (BME), Clare Brennan (Over 50's), Joe Taylor (Heritage)</p>
<p>Apologies: Pam Stewart, Sullyman Mohammed </p>
<p>Carol pointed out that Ray Hutchinson (Faith Network) has a heavy workload 
  and cannot always be free for meetings. It is essential that we remember this 
  and make an effort to keep him in the information loop</p>
<p>Minutes 05.01.09 - true and accurate</p>
<p>Matters Arising.</p>
<p>It had been agreed that the treasurer of Encompass should gain a relevant accreditation 
  ASAP so as to be able to guide all member organisations into similar and correct 
  financial practices. Discussion on this matter was deferred to the 'training' 
  agenda item. </p>
<p>Clare Brennan was delegated to take care of negotiations for Tudor House and 
  has done so - discussion deferred to the relevant agenda item.</p>
<p>The secretary was delegated to arrange the next Ascend meeting, in conjunction 
  with the chair, and to develop a marketing strategy for the website. This matter 
  was deferred to the end of the meeting to ensure the important matters concerning 
  Tudor House could be deal with thoroughly. </p>
<p>Bank Account &amp; Related Financial Matters:</p>
<p>An updated Excel record of all financial transactions, since the first Encompass 
  bank account was opened 23 Oct 2007, was presented and scrutinised. Cheques 
  for World In Wigan, Heritage Network, Over 50's and Hindley Community Association 
  were distributed and &pound;25 for petty cash was handed to the treasurer. The 
  cheque for BWCN was unfortunately not obtained at the same time due to email 
  difficulties. The cheque for BWCN will be obtained at the treasurer's convenience. 
  The chair, on behalf of Encompass, signed the six-month lease for Tudor House. 
  The secretary has misplaced the bankbook for the original account. He passed 
  on a deposit receipt containing the original bank account roll number so that 
  a copy can be obtained from the bank, if necessary.</p>
<p>Routes to Involvement:</p>
<p>Carol Watson briefly outlined the developing process. She, the secretary and 
  Marion would like to attend the meeting 24 Feb. Carol will email Sian Jay to 
  inquire about numbers.</p>
<p>Wigan Borough Partnership Conference Pack Newsletter: </p>
<p>The secretary prepared a draft to which Sian Jay made suggestions and the chair 
  made final amendments. The secretary forwarded a logo to Katie Long who will 
  print off the newsletter and include in the conference pack. This newsletter 
  includes the website address and it is hoped that some attendees respond and 
  become involved in developing the new Community Network.</p>
<p>Future Training Requirements For Network Leads:</p>
<p>Carol uses Jane Williams, the community accountant from St Helens CVS, for 
  the Grange Community Centre. It was agreed that we engaged Jane Williams for 
  half a day to outline accountancy procedures to Irene and Khaled in order to 
  help them to take forward their roles in a professional manner. Further accredited 
  training will be undertaken at a later date Training for members of all organisations 
  is a priority for Encompass. Network leads agreed to establish the need of their 
  particular members and report back to the next meeting.</p>
<p>Minutes 22.01.09: true and accurate</p>
<p>Matters Arising: none.</p>
<p>Tudor House - Progress Report:</p>
<p>The premises have been secured and a great deal of office furniture has been 
  donated from council. The arrival of this furniture was delayed due to the unexpected 
  heavy snow but is expected to be in place soon. Irene Yates has written a letter 
  of appreciation to the relevant officers, on behalf of Disability Forum and 
  all the other Networks. She read the letter to the meeting as was thanked by 
  all present for a job well done </p>
<p>The matter of public liability and contents insurance needs addressing. Irene 
  was tasked with investigating this, Marion to assist with values for furniture.</p>
<p>Phil Hirst has offered to help with IT matters and this offer was gratefully 
  accepted. Carol suggested that Phil be invited to the next meeting.<br>
  .</p>
<p>The Next Ascend Meeting at the Town Hall: </p>
<p>The secretary reported on progress regarding this meeting, which will be at 
  Wigan Town Hall 25th Feb. He has been in contact with The Community Development 
  Exchange and Community North West regarding this event and they have indicated 
  a willingness to assist and participate. Khaled will start webpage maintenance 
  training with Joe next week and will assist with the webpage development. A 
  marketing strategy to launch the website and promote Ascend has been developed 
  using various local newspapers that will require some expenditure. It was agreed 
  that money should be spent on a quarter page advert if required to help launch 
  the website. The secretary and the chair will confer on details. </p>
<p> <br>
  Date of Next Meeting: </p>
<p>Another meeting regarding Tudor House will need to happen soon. Joe queried 
  whether all members needed to attend. Carol pointed out that Joe's services 
  would be needed as Secretary and that this business was relevant to all Encompass 
  members as joint decisions were to be made. The date and time of the next Encompass 
  meeting will be decided after members have checked their availability. Please 
  let Carol know as soon as possible.<br>
