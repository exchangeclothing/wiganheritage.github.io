Minutes of Meeting ( 8 December 2004 ): Proposed as a true record by Tim Hall, 
seconded by Geoff Roberts.<br>
Matters Arising: We need to agree on a name before signing off the Terms of Reference. 
Mo Burgess suggested &quot;Encompass&quot; - agreed.<br>
It had been agreed that &quot;a designated substitute can attend in exceptional 
circumstances and should be continually updated about the work of the group&quot; 
- this needs to happen in practice.<br>
Minutes of Meeting ( 12 January 2005 ): Proposed as a true record by Tim Hall, 
seconded by Geoff Roberts.<br>
Matters Arising: Over 50's grant award agreed sum of &pound;11,700.<br>
Terms of Reference: Two amendments had been made to include (a) eligibility of 
the Youth Council to attend and (b) reference to designated substitutes. Following 
agreement of the name the Terms of Reference were signed off.<br>
Date of the Next Meetings: Monday, 4 April 2005 at the Queen's Hall, Wigan ; Monday, 
23 May at the Leigh Ethnic Centre; Monday, 4 July, Wigan ; Monday, <br>
22 August, Leigh. All meetings to commence at 2.00 pm .<br>
Delivery Plan: Nick gave the background to the Local Area Agreements. Wigan is 
one of 21 pilot areas where agreements are made between the Local Authority and 
Central Government over certain targets that the Local Authority has to meet in 
return for funds allocated. These funds are generally restricted but the question 
has been posed as to what we would do if some of these funding streams were freed 
up from rules and regulations. Signing up to Public Service Agreement 2 identifies 
certain targets which must be met but there is also an extra pot of money (&pound;9 
million over 3 years) which is allocated to provide for extra agreed targets. 
Wigan 's bid to Central Government includes representatives from the voluntary/community 
sector and questions are being asked about how community empowerment works - once 
targets have been set they want to see results. At present the Community Empowerment 
Programme and CVS receive funds via the Neighbourhood Renewal scheme and have 
been happy with the independence this provides in the delivery of our work within 
the local community, but Central Government could take this funding under its 
wing and allocation would be via the Local Strategic Partnership. This could mean 
that community empowerment funding and the flexibility it offers could be taken 
from us. The local area agreement currently includes community empowerment funding 
and we should carry on with the delivery plan as it is. There is no real risk 
that LSP will take over control of the funding but it is evident that other people 
will become more interested in how it is spent and with what results.<br>
Information distributed: - Safer and Stronger Communities Fund <br>
- Wigan Council &quot;Achieving our Potential&quot; Local Area <br>
Agreement - Feb 05 <br>
- PSA Floor Targets, Local Authority Profiles - <br>
Jan 05 <br>
Single Community Programme Delivery Plan <br>
2004/05 (V2 Feb 04)<br>
Discussion then followed on the various themes of the Delivery Plan and possible 
ways forward. These will be circulated with a request that you all prioritise 
- high, medium or low. (There is a short timescale for return as the draft delivery 
plan has to be submitted to Government Office before 28 February 2005 .) Resultant 
actions from this exercise will be allocated according to those best placed to 
'making them happen'. This is different to the 'provision of service to carry 
out the action', for which a tendering process will be required. The Government 
Office will require clear evidence that this process has taken place. It was agreed 
that the Community Empowerment Programme Team would write up the expected outcomes 
of the actions undertaken and the estimated cost. Details would be circulated 
as soon as possible.<br>
Following a meeting with the Government Office, Katy explained that there was 
a possibility that future funding for CEP could be cut. She gave the figures as 
follows:<br>
100% = &pound;385377 <br>
80% = &pound;308302 <br>
60% = &pound;231226<br>
Staff/running costs would account for &pound;105483 and a further cost of approx 
10% as management fee for whoever oversees the distribution of grants from the 
Community Chest and Community Learning Chest. This had previously been undertaken 
by Douglas Valley and Nick pointed out that it does not necessarily have to be 
them. Following discussion as to who could feasibly take over at this late stage, 
it was agreed at the meeting (Mike O'Brien stepped out for this discussion) that 
Douglas Valley should continue to do so. Further discussion then followed on how 
the grants should be awarded. Should networks be granted a lump sum and they then 
handle their own budget or should they apply through Douglas Valley for each project 
separately? Douglas Valley could accommodate whatever process we wished to adopt. 
Nick was uneasy about allocating lump sums to networks as rigorous evidence needs 
to be available on what the money was intended for and how it was spent. This 
has not always been forthcoming from some groups in the past. Strong systems, 
processes and procedures need to be established so all are accountable.<br>
