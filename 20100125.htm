<p>John O'Neill opened the meeting by welcoming those present noted apologies 
  and made the following announcements:</p>
<p>The meeting arranged by the Environment Agency between Red Rose Forest and 
  the bird watching fraternity concerning the Heritage Lottery Bid for Lightshaw 
  Meadows has been re-arranged for a date in February. </p>
<p>The site visit to Haigh Hall has been arranged for Monday 1st of March from 
  10.30 to 1.00 followed by lunch. This will include a workshop relating to the 
  future use of Haigh Hall and the surrounding woodland area, one of the key ingredients 
  to the Greenheart Project.</p>
<p>The meeting between Environment &amp; Heritage Network and the Bio Diversity 
  Group will be on the 18th of February at the Town Hall, starting at 6.00 for 
  refreshments.</p>
<p>Local History Day this year is Saturday 5th of June</p>
<p>At Wigan Pier on the 4th of February, there are craft exhibitions and workshops 
  all day from 10.00 - 4.00 at The Way We Were, just run up anytime during the 
  day.</p>
<p>Minutes of the last meeting - true and accurate, passed</p>
<p>Matters arising: </p>
<p>The &pound;3000 from Awards for All, to help new groups, was discussed. </p>
<p>In view of the constitution provided by Jan Johnson from the Hesketh Meadows 
  Action Group, it was agreed that this group would be allocated &pound;300 to 
  help them get established.</p>
<p>The Friends of Wigan Pier Quarter Group was allocated &pound;300 at our last 
  meeting but the cheque has not yet been issued you. </p>
<p>With this &pound;600 taken into consideration, that leaves &pound;475 from 
  the &pound;3000. We have to report to Awards For All by May. It was agreed that 
  we should purchase a digital projector for use by all the member groups (as 
  is the premises at Tudor House). Joe Taylor and Geoff Jones will consider options 
  and look at insurance for the projector. Should any surplus remain from the 
  &pound;3000 when the report it due, the meeting agreed to donate it to the Discovery 
  Group towards equipment costs.</p>
<p>Richard Sivill reported that he had tried to encourage new groups in the Atherton 
  area to take advantage of this limited funding opportunity. </p>
<p>Rachel Orme then gave an update on progress with the former History Shop and 
  the Outreach program that has been in place during renovations. </p>
<p>The renamed Museum of Wigan Life (previously The History Shop) will reopen 
  to the public on Friday 9th April. We would like to invite the Heritage Network 
  (either as a group or as the wider groups people on the Network represent) to 
  the newly refurbished Museum between 9th April and 16th June for a preview/feedback 
  visit. We would really like to know what you think about the refurbishment and 
  the new exhibitions, and hope that the Heritage Network can use the Museum as 
  a platform for their own groups and objectives. We will be offering a brand 
  new programme of events and activities, and these will be available to the Network 
  before reopening, and will hopefully be of interest.</p>
<p>Please contact The Museum of Wigan Life/Rachel Bryant for further information: 
  (01942) 828121.</p>
<p>The next round of Heritage Service's Curating in the Community grant funding 
  will be available from April 2010. </p>
<p>Please contact Rachel Bryant for further information/application form: r.bryant@wlct.org</p>
<p>John O'Neill commented that the 'outreach' program and proved to be a good 
  initiative, especially where schools were concerned, has got people involved 
  more directly in local environment and heritage issues. He will again talk to 
  the Township Forum management team about getting environment and heritage included 
  as a permanent agenda item.</p>
<p>Review of the Action Plan:</p>
<p>The two points under discussion were (1) 'promote individuals &amp; group membership' 
  and (2) promote the significance of environment/heritage issues through temporary 
  exhibitions as the history shop' (note the HS is now the Museum of Wigan Life).</p>
<p>On point (1) it was suggested we should have a poster designed to put up in 
  all the libraries, we use Past Forward more often, try to get an article in 
  Borough Life, have something up in the Museum of Wigan Life and for as many 
  members as possible to attend the meeting with the Bio Diversity Partnership 
  on the 18th of February. </p>
<p>On point (2) Ken Barston has produced a booklet and a calendar relating to 
  Stubshaw Cross. It is advantageous to develop relationships with reporters from 
  local newspapers. The Blue Book is a good outlet for articles in the Leigh/Atherton/Tyldesley 
  area; the Courier is a good outlet for articles in the North part of the borough.</p>
<p>Members Reports: <br>
  Members present who gave verbal reports about their many and varied activities 
  were Tom Glover, Avis Freeman, Glenys McClellan, Richard Sivill, Mary Pennington, 
  Ken Barston and John O'Neill. <br>
  Joe Taylor (Billinge History/Heritage Society) provided this written report.<br>
  Sales of The Billingers are going reasonably well and half the cost of printing 
  has been recovered so far. When the full cost is recovered, the surplus will 
  go to the Environment &amp; Heritage Network. <br>
  Geoff Jones (Astley Green Colliery Museum) provided this written report.</p>
<p>Our current major development is the extension to our narrow gauge railway, 
  which will ultimately let us take passengers, in authentic colliery rolling 
  stock, to the Boothstown border. This would give a return journey of about one 
  and a quarter miles. Complicated planning permission, land retrieval and the 
  adverse weather have held us back, but the surveyor should arrive this week 
  to peg out the future line and then our contractors will start the required 
  earthworks. Once these activities are complete we can then start to lay the 
  actual track. Phase 1 will take us to the Bridgewater Canal, followed, subject 
  to funding, by Phase 2 to a picnic site on the border.</p>
<p>Our HLF bid has been put in abeyance until we can find alternative accommodation 
  for the many bits and pieces stacked in one of the building's rooms.</p>
<p>Previous attempts to obtain a container from a farm have fallen by the wayside 
  so we have decided to bite the bullet and buy a second hand container ourselves.</p>
<p>School visits and outreach talks/ slideshows are beginning to be booked, with 
  interest currently shown by schools in St. Helens and Warrington who have never 
  visited before. Also 60 pupils and teachers from France are due to visit in 
  April.</p>
<p>We are also in negotiation for a diesel generator as we have nearly exhausted 
  all the available power from our meagre electrics. This will prevent 'Coronation 
  Street' becoming a small dot on village T.V.s. We are continuing in resolving 
  leakage problems on our currently Sleeping Giant, the Winding Engine, although 
  we have disturbed it from its slumbers on several occasions. This has freed 
  the movement by successful trials with compressed air. </p>
<p>We now have a written guide sheet for visitors who wish to explore the site 
  on their own and have improved information signs throughout the site.</p>
<p>BBC Bristol has carried out a short introduction for the Flog It programme 
  and I am waiting to hear when the programme will be shown. Also media study 
  students from Manchester University have made a short film at the museum about 
  the Miners' Strike.</p>
<p>Bolton School pupils are also to visit to discuss how they can make a similar 
  short film about the Pretoria Pit Disaster.<br>
  Any Other Business:<br>
  John O'Neill distributed a copy of the material displayed on the new Shevington 
  'interpretation board and copies of the latest Royal Horticultural Society judging 
  criteria which includes environment &amp; heritage aspects and a recent Royal 
  Society for the Protection of Birds letter appealing to the government to favourable 
  consider the society's work when making budget cuts'<br>
  Brian Parr asked if the Network could be a consultee for any proposed developments 
  where there is a potential impact upon heritage and the environment. John O'Neill 
  is engaged in conversations regarding this matter with the Environment Services 
  Department.<br>
  Next Meeting: <br>
  March 8th at Tudor House 10.30 a.m.<br>
