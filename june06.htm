<p>Minutes of the last meeting: </p>
<p>The minuets of the last meeting were discussed point-by-point and accepted 
  as true and accurate. </p>
<p>Matter Arising:</p>
<p>Since the last meeting contact has been made with the Leisure and Culture Trust 
  about the mapping of points of heritage interest in the Billinge/Orrell Ward. 
  This exercise is seen as a pilot that might be extended to cover the Borough. 
  Philip Butler explained that this particular ward was chosen due to the presence 
  of a flourishing history society, which is not the case in all wards of the 
  Borough. The mapping of the entire Borough could be a project for this group 
  could work in partnership with and to help facilitate. </p>
<p>Aims and Objectives:</p>
<p>Several people for various groups had input into the drafting of a set of aims 
  and objectives for the Wigan Borough Heritage Network. After further discussion 
  it was decided unanimously that that the following should be accepted.</p>
<p>Wigan Borough Heritage Network </p>
<p>Aims</p>
<p>To provide a forum where persons and community based organisations, concerned 
  with archaeology, history and heritage matters throughout the Wigan Borough, 
  are able meet on a regular basis, to exchange news, views and aspirations</p>
<p>To promote interest in and maintain appreciation of the archaeology, history 
  and heritage of the entire Wigan Borough, its culture, buildings and natural 
  environment, by whatever means are within the capabilities of the Wigan Borough 
  Heritage Network</p>
<p>Objectives</p>
<p>To support, promote and resource members and member organisations in achieving 
  the aims of the Wigan Borough Heritage Network </p>
<p>To identify and map all points of heritage significance throughout the Wigan 
  Borough and to devise strategies to preserve them for future generations</p>
<p>To work in partnership with relevant Wigan Council Departments and Wigan Leisure 
  &amp; Culture Trust in matters concerning archaeology, heritage and history</p>
<p>To provide community representation on the LSP and relevant thematic partnerships</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>At this stage it was decided that Wigan Borough Heritage Network dose not need 
  a constitution but should the need arise in the future, a suitable constitution 
  will be drafted. </p>
<p>Reports From Members:</p>
<p>Derek and Michael reported on the present difficulties in maintaining their 
  group in Golborne due to lack of an adequate facility for holding meetings and 
  the need for equipment. Billinge History/Heritage Society will forward them 
  a constitution to adapt and accept so that they will be eligible for funding. 
</p>
<p>John Wogan and Tony Haslam reported that a website had dramatically increased 
  interest in Wigan family history.</p>
<p>Rev Ray Hutchinson explained that, due to clearance, there are many items of 
  heritage significance at Wigan Parish Church that need to be found new homes. 
  Philip Butler was keen to assist in this matter.</p>
<p>Tom Glover highlighted his group's need to acquire more modern equipment. This 
  problem might be solved by a funding application and support to apply for funding 
  was offered. Tom expressed concern that Wigan Council use Manchester Archaeology 
  Society for consultation in preference to Wigan Archaeology Society. It was 
  pointed out that one of the objectives of Wigan Borough Heritage Network is 
  to work in partnership with relevant Wigan Council Departments.</p>
<p>Cllr O'Neil spoke about the various strategies Council adopt for Heritage issues 
  and how Wigan Borough Heritage Network could be used to recourse the relevant 
  networks by providing community input and representation. At this moment in 
  time, the Planning Department has a vacancy for a Conservation Officer. Cllr 
  O'Neill suggested that matters relating to conservation could, for the time 
  being, be channelled through him. </p>
<p>Joe Taylor distributed a Heritage DVD that has been produced by a group in 
  Moss Bank with funding from Heritage Lottery. A list of speakers can be emailed 
  to interested parties. </p>
<p>Partnership Support Officer:</p>
<p>Lynn Kay explained how the many community and voluntary groups throughout the 
  Borough are linked and brought into the decision making process through the 
  Wigan Borough Partnership. Lynn gave a brief overview on the structure of the 
  Wigan Borough Partnership which is the Local Strategic Partnership for Wigan 
  Borough. The Wigan Borough Partnership is responsible for the Community Plan 
  (copies of this will be made available to members) and spoke about the 7 Thematic 
  Partnerships, that each deal with specific key issues:<br>
  &middot; Health &amp; Social Care Partnership<br>
  &middot; Economic Partnership<br>
  &middot; Children Young Peoples Partnership<br>
  &middot; Community Safety Partnership<br>
  &middot; Housing Partnership<br>
  &middot; Environment &amp; Development Partnership<br>
  &middot; Cultural Partnership</p>
<p>Lynn also spoke about the 10 Township Forums - Each of the borough's 10 Township 
  areas has a Forum that works to develop local partnerships, making services 
  more effective by getting local people involved in their own communities and 
  working on local issues. </p>
<p>Lynn agreed to provide information to the group on local grant funding and 
  also provide more information on the Township Forums and their local action 
  plans.</p>
<p>Next Meeting:</p>
