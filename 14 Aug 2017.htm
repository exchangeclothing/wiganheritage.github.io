<p>Presentation: by Anna Hetterley</p>
<p>Anna gave a detailed presentation regarding the Carbon Landscape Project, which 
  aims to reconnect people to their landscapes and nature. It is resourced by 
  Lancashire Wild Life Trust, led by Manchester University&#146;s School of Environment, 
  Education &amp; Development and made possible with a &pound;2 million grant 
  from Heritage Lottery.</p>
<p>The project covers a wide area, between Wigan, Warrington and Salford and aims 
  to restore elements of the carbon landscape and reconnect them with the communities 
  who live alongside then, while improving access, learning opportunities and 
  skills. It is a five year project and already 22 projects within it have started 
  to date. More information can be found online and there is Fecebook page and 
  a Twitter account.</p>
<p>Anna answered questions from members and was thanked by the chair for a very 
  worthwhile, informative presentation.</p>
<p>It is to be hoped that she will return with an update some time in the future.</p>

  I went to Belgium in July for the commemorations of the Battle of Passchendaele

  on the Menin Gate and another buried in the China Wall Cemetery. The authorities 
  kindly opened Passchendaele Church for us so that we could observe the memorial 
  window to the 66th East Lancashire Division which contains the town shields 
  of Wigan, Leigh, Bury, Bolton, Accrington, Manchester, Chester, Blackburn, Burnley, 
  Padiham, Bacup and Todmorden</p>
