<p>Matters Arising. None.<br>
  Presentations:<br>
  The four offices attending the meeting spoke at length regarding future plans 
  and aspirations on matters such as the Cultural Manifesto and the Historic Environment 
  Strategy. A general discussion ensued as members asked questions and voiced 
  opinions, e.g. David Shallcross asked about the street scene on Leigh's main 
  thoroughfares e.g. dilapidated shops and businesses and the colour owners could 
  use to decorate them. David also ask about the plans for Pennington Flash and 
  what happened to the consultation meetings that were set up to gather the public&#146;s 
  thoughts on its uses, there has only been one without any follow-up or results 
  of that first meeting.</p>
