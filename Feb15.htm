<p>Minutes of the last meeting: True and accurate.<br>
  <br>
  Matters Arising: </p>
<p>David Shallcross took advantage of the secretary&#146;s offer to teach members 
  how to communicate via Skype or Google Hangout. The offer remains open to all 
  memebers.</p>
<p>The leader of council replied to the network&#146;s query regarding devolution 
  to Greater Manchester.</p>
<p>John Rowan, the conservation officer, was unable to make the meeting. John 
  O&#146;Neil outlined what the conservation office would have reported:</p>
<p>There are plans to close Wallgate Station and integrate train services with. 
  Wigan North West. The station building will be retained as a historic building.<br>
  The owners of the privately owned historic buildings on Wallgate are not obliged 
  to update unless the building become a danger to the public. They are being 
  encouraged to upgrade via access to grants. Pools Pie Shop is being upgraded 
  and there are hopes that the Victoria Hotel will be re-painted.</p>
<p>It is difficult for officers to get good news publicised but voluntary groups 
  are able to forward positive press releases. Avis passed around a number of 
  articles published recently concerning environment and heritage matters.</p>
<p>The boundary stone dumped at Platt Bridge has been restored to its rightful 
  spot in Leigh.</p>
<p>A visitors centre is envisioned for Greenheart and a competition is underway 
  for the best design.</p>
<p>Mary distributed archaeology newsletters and Glenys distributed the 2015 programme 
  for Leigh FHS.</p>
<p>Members News:</p>
<p>Given verbally. Members to email in reports to be included in the minutes.</p>
<p>Astley Green Colliery Museum:<br>
  Perhaps the most interesting activity to take place at the museum was the use 
  of a Quadcopter to film the Headgear (Mine Tower). For those people not in the 
  know, a Quadcopter&nbsp; looks a bit like a model helicopter bur instead of 
  2 rotors, it has 4 vertical mounted propellers and a camera slung beneath it. 
  The operator could get it up to 400 feet and circle the structure easily. If 
  you want to see the results go into Youtube, put in Astley Green Mining Museum 
  and somewhere, amongst the rest, is the film it produced. It only lasts for 
  a few minutes but was just the job on a misty morning. Paul Prescot, who owns 
  the Quadcopter, says he will return in the summer to do an aerial view of the 
  entire site, all free of charge. How rare is that!<br>
  An HLF grant put together by us and a local school, entitled Digging for Victory, 
  has had to be put on hold as the teacher I was dealing with , due to budget 
  cuts, has unfortunately lost her job.<br>
  Railway progress continues and there is now a project to join the end of the 
  line to gain access to the garage. The garage has a pit which would come in 
  very useful for servicing locomotives and rolling stock.<br>
  We are about to put together a calendar to show when we intend to run the Winding 
  Engine. We have to treat the old girl with respect, she is after all 103 years 
  old , but strangely enough when we come to put her into motion, it&#146;s always 
  something else, more modern, which goes wrong. We call it the Astley Disease. 
  You always have to fix something before you can use it. It doesn&#146;t matter 
  if it&#146;s a compressor or a hammer!</p>
