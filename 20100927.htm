  for volunteers.<br>
  &middot; Tom Price reported that the advertising for Heritage Open days was 
  not the best and more time is needed for next year. Venues such as churches 
  would benefit by having a guide or an A4 sheet of information available. <br>

  PCT lasts.</p>
<p>Budgetary Issues: </p>
<p>There are still small grants available via Council. Anne Roberts is the person 
  to contact. Monies are available via Section 106 agreements. The relevant planning 
  officer should be contacted. Township Forums have budgets that can be used for 
  environment related work. Brighter Borough money is available from local councillors. 
  Small parcels of unused public land could be utilised and developed for local 
  projects.<br>

  Community Partnership Heritage Sub-Group Meeting:</p>
<p>This meeting wasn't held due to unforeseen circumstances - it will be rearranged.

  Boar War Memorial in Mesnes Park, Haigh Estate, Lightshaw Meadows and phase 
  2 of the Mesnes Park Restoration.</p>

  mechanism, so far with limited success. They have involved volunteers interested 
  in archaeology, including school children and the disabled, for the first time. 
</p>
<p>Greenheart DVD:</p>
<p>Peter Goodwin showed the DVD he produced recently with rugby league commentator 
  Phil Clarke about the Greenheart Project.</p>
<p>It is heartening to observe that the higher echelons are staring to realise 
  that the real value of the borough lies in its unique natural heritage and this 
  could a principal selling point for marketing Wigan.</p>

  attending had requested that the discussion be kept in-house.</p>
