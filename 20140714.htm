<p>Tour of Greenslate Community Farm:</p>
<p>Most of the day was taken up with tour of the community farm and all its facilities. 
  This project is one of the successful applicants to the Community Investment 
  Fund and is a prime example of how the neighbourhood groups will need to adapt 
  if public services, as we are accustomed to having them, are to remain.</p>
<p>This project, only running for a year or so, already has over 30 community 
  allotments producing large quantities of organic vegetables, rescue hens producing 
  eggs, pigs producing pork, a wild flower meadow for bees, a care farm to help 
  people with learning disabilities, children's clubs, a woodland area being developed 
  in conjunction with Wildlife Trust, dale ponies being trained for agricultural 
  use, several acres being developed to produce wholesale organic vegetables to 
  feed the community, and more.</p>
<p>Its governance structure, under the Industrial and Provident Societies Act 
  1965, defines it as 'company for the benefit of the community' and as such is 
  able to issues shares. These shares cannot be traded on the stock exchange for 
  personal benefit but can be redeemed from the company on request. Avis Freeman 
  and Peter Goodwin decided to buy a &pound;25 share in the community farm and 
  it was decided that Environment &amp; Heritage Network would also buy a share.<br>
</p>
<p>Minutes of Last Meeting: True and accurate - passed.</p>
<p>Matters Arising:</p>
<p>An action meeting re Leigh Spinners has occurred. <br>
  Members Reports: </p>
<p>Most given verbally.</p>
<p>Tom Price provided the following written report:</p>
<p>Foremost on our agenda at the present is the consideration of 11 nominations 
  for our Malcolm Forest Civic Trust Award. Any of these nominations that conform 
  to our specific guidelines can win an award in the year of its nomination. Some 
  nominations selected for this years awards and why they have been selected are:</p>
<p>Mesnes Park:<br>
  A delightful transformation by WLCT to a once rundown and somewhat neglected 
  town centre leisure facility, brought back to its former glory with the re-introduction 
  of the Pelham Fountain, the Lodge refurbishment and added conference centre 
  plus the replaced Boer War Memorial, now the Park is once again a source pleasure 
  for Wigan's inhabitants.</p>
<p>Brock Mill Farm:<br>
  Transformed from a derelict 200 year old farmhouse to a smartly renovated modern 
  dwelling, rebuilt to contain all its old world charm with the stone flag flooring, 
  exposed original beams and sympathetically finished stonework, this Building 
  is a credit to its new owners. The stepped landscaping at the front marrying 
  into the surrounding woodland completes a well thought out picturesque project.</p>
<p>Standish Health Centre:<br>
  A new rear section to this building of red brickwork blends well with the front 
  of the building, made from sawn sandstone blocks and a modern type entrance 
  fronting the main road. It sits well within its environment and is a pleasure 
  to behold. This is a well thought-out architectural accomplishment.</p>
<p>Other Business:</p>
<p>John O'Neil gave an update on progress with the Waterloo Monument and reported 
  that the WLT will retain sport and fitness as a core issue. Environment and 
  Heritage will come back to Council.</p>
<p><br>
  Next Meeting:</p>
<p>September 1st Museum of Wigan Life starting at 10.30.</p>
