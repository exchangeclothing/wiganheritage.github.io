<p>John O'Neill opened the meeting by welcoming those members present and noted 
  apologies.</p>
<p>Martin Purcell, the Greenheart Programme Manager, updated members on the Regional 
  Park. He explained how Greenheart is centred around the former Coalfield Industrial 
  Areas in the Southern sector of the Borough with connecting corridors Westwards 
  to the Ashton-in-Makerfield /Three Sisters then in a North Easterly direction 
  to Wigan Flashes and Amberswood and finally Northwards into Haigh. With these 
  main centre points, connections are also being made into other areas. The concept 
  is to bring a high quality landscape and leisure pursuits to all areas of the 
  Borough and consultation with local groups that have a more intimate knowledge 
  of their area, a satisfactory programme can be achieved under the guidance of 
  the Partnership Officers. </p>
<p> A prime example mentioned was the site of the old Kirkless Steelworks, reputed 
  to be the largest in Europe during its heyday (important enough for the attempt 
  of its destruction during WW1).</p>
<p>Network members will be fully consulted on environmental and heritage issues 
  across Greenheart. Members thanked Martin for his presentation. </p>
<p>The Booklet and update sheet will be available on request from absent members.</p>

<p>Wigan Borough in Bloom</p>
<p>A comprehensive handout entitled &quot;Environmental Aims And Objectives&quot; 
  presented by John O'Neill outlined the future objectives for the Borough. Building 
  on the success of recent years work, the document covers the whole spectrum 
  of environmental issues.</p>
<p>The Chair reported on how the people are encouraged to follow the Council initiative 
  and plant floral displays wherever possible to brighten up the environment and 
  help lift the community spirit in times of stress. </p>
<p>It is hoped that in the near future that land will be made available for the 
  creation of Allotments, to encourage people to &quot;grow your own&quot; vegetables 
  and flowers.<br>
  This land needs to be freely available to aspiring gardeners with no obstacles 
  hindering progress.</p>
<p> An annual workshop has been established whereby people working for a better 
  and brighter community, can come along and tell what they have achieved, and 
  receive accolades for their efforts.</p>

  helping to contribute to the bigger picture of Greenheart.</p>
