  Greenheart Report from Martin Purcell</p>
<p>Work towards the Greenheart Delivery Plan includes feasibility studies and 
  work on the ground.</p>
<p>'Access Strategy' has gone through consultation and various schemes are happening 
  as a result. This covers not just access points to Greenheart but links between 
  areas. The Boroughwide Access Strategy has been looking at reducing the number 
  of barriers on public footpaths to improve access for those with mobility scooters 
  and wheelchairs.</p>
<p>How Greenheart manages sites may become tricky as government 'future jobs' 
  schemes are due to be axed. There is a bid to secure &pound;300 per hectare 
  for 10 years for Amberswood as part of a newly created 'Greenheart farm'. Also 
  work to improve the canal path from Bamfurlong to Dover Lock and then hopefully 
  on to Plank Lane.</p>
<p>Work is going on to raise the profile of Greenheart including website, brand 
  and logo. Publicity has been gained for projects at Lightshaw and the Haigh 
  windmill. There are plans for a 3-5 minute Greenheart film to be made by Cathy 
  Peloe who works in Wigan Council communications team.</p>
<p>The local PCT recently joined the Greenheart board.</p>

  'Humberts Leisure' have been appointed.</p>

<p>Amberswood - first draft of plan has been completed. There is a proposal to 
  extend the cycle path across from Hindley.</p>
<p>Wigan Flashes are a key site. Looking at establishing a car park and a small 
  office for Lancashire Wildlife Trust on Welham Road next to Hawkley Hall High 
  School. Also proposal to improve linkage from Wigan Flashes to Three Sisters.</p>
<p>Ince Moss - it is proposed to construct a pedestrian bridge to link it better 
  to the Flashes.</p>
<p>Bickershaw North - various leisure plans including the golf course are on hold. 
  A considerable sum has already been spent on a ne road and preparation work.

  in national decline.</p>
<p>Bridgewater Canal has its 250th anniversary next year. Planning to link up 
  with this.</p>

<p>John O'Neill proposed the idea of a celebration evening and asked the meeting 
  what it thought. Rachel Bryant offered the Museum of Wigan Life as a venue. 
  John also mentioned the idea of having a 10-minute slot in each 6-weekly meeting 
  for one group in turn to make a presentation to the rest of the Network. John 
  will meet with Joe Taylor and Tom Price to discuss further.<br>
  <br>
  Events 2010 to 2011</p>
<p>John O'Neill described display in library that was up in first week of June 
  about Elnup<br>
  Wood, which was bought by community from NCB for &pound;1. The area is historic 
  and had <br>
  a corn mill on it up to the 19th Century.</p>
<p>27th November this year is Lancashire Day when groups are encouraged to run 
  events.</p>
<p>John O'Neill invited suggestions from the group for visits for the coming year.

<p><br>
  Cultural Partnership Convention</p>
<p>The 2010 Wigan Borough Cultural Partnership Convention is taking place at 09.30 
  on Saturday 10th July at Formby Hall, Atherton. All members of the Environment 
  and Heritage Network are encouraged to attend.</p>
<p>Any Other Business</p>
<p>John O'Neill highlighted a Local History News article about engaging older 
  people. This followed on from the discussion at a previous Network meeting. 
  The article described the ideas of an organisation who produced large print 
  mock newspapers which can be used in reminiscence work with older people. www.dailysparkle.co.uk</p>
<p>Section 106 planning monies are generated from new developments and spent on 
  various types of maintenance by the Council. Township Forums influence how it 
  is spent. Up to December 2009, Wigan Council had committed &pound;3 million, 
  but still had &pound;300,000 left to allocate. It was suggested that Network 
  members might be able to get money towards some of their projects and interests. 
  Jackie Roberts (Bridleways) reported that she had tried through local Township 
  to get money for resurfacing paths, but had been unsuccessful. It was noted 
  that the Townships are currently being re-organised and the new set-up is due 
  to go live on 1st November 2010.</p>
