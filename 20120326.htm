  None</p>
<p>Presentation on the Kirkless Site by Liz Vango-Smith, Lancs Wildlife Trust:</p>
<p>The site can be accessed from Bell Green Lane, Ince, and via the canal path 
  at Top Loch. This site was once home to the world's largest Iron and Steel facility 
  and the glow from the furnaces lit the night sky. It was reputedly at target 
  for Zeppelin bombing in the First World War. The waste from the industrial process 
  has caused a unique range of fauna, more in keeping with a costal dune environment. 
  Motorbike and four-wheel drive access is a problem and as the site is developed, 
  this aspect will have to be looked at, as will access for horses. The Wildlife 
  Trust is hopeful that a Friends Group might develop and members are asked to 
  encourage this. Liz is the contact for this development and can be reached in 
  01942 233976 or by email at lvango@lancswt.org.uk</p>
<p>Presentation by Richard Sivill:</p>
<p>Richard had brought a number of artefacts along with him and told stories relating 
  to each of them. These included the records of the local co-operative society 
  1857 - 1907 and a book called 'Changes in Men and Manners', 1880, which lamented 
  the growing access to shooting for the 'common man'. He had several long service 
  awards, a memorial to the Penny Gate mining disaster at Ince in 1875, the Atherton 
  Official Guide 1950, Guild of the Coalfields 1971 and the magazines of the Atherton 
  and Manchester Collieries. On a more personal note, Richard had retained a box 
  of collar studs against the eventuality of them coming back in fashion. It was 
  a reminder of how our heritage is the foundation of the present and how much 
  is contained within the memory of anyone of us.</p>
