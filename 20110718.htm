<p>Members Reports:</p>
<p>Astley Green Colliery Museum Report <br>
  <br>
  Previous discussions with Andy Burnham, M.P. for Leigh have resulted in an assurance 
  from him that he will hold a meeting with ourselves and representatives from 
  English Heritage, H.L.F. and Wigan L &amp; C T to gain support for future development. 
  Repairs are still being made to the recently vandalised generator so that we 
  can operate the Winding Engine again on a monthly basis. Batteries and cabling 
  had been removed from the Generator resulting in about &pound;400's worth of 
  rectification.</p>
<p>An English Heritage Grant application is progressing in order that we can have 
  a Structural Survey carried out of the Headgear, the only one still standing 
  in the former Lancashire and Cheshire Coalfield.</p>
<p>21 visits or outreach activities have taken place this year to date with societies 
  and clubs as diverse as The Women's' Association of Great Britain and the Maharishi 
  School.</p>
<p>The railway extension is progressing but is very much 'weather dependent' as 
  some of us are getting quite rusty from over exposure to the rain!</p>
<p>We are hosting Family Days on the four Thursdays in August. Wigan Heritage 
  Service are putting together the programme of events which we will have an active 
  part in, so if anyone has any bored children or grandchildren to look after 
  in the summer holidays then contact Sue Maiden at the Museum of Wigan Life on 
  01942 828124 to book places. </p>
<p>Any Other Business:</p>
<p>Avis reported that the Leigh Park Group are concerned about a development proposal 
  at the Leigh College Building purchased by the Silcock Family, possibly intended 
  for conversion to make it a fairground museum.</p>
<p>Joe Taylor reported that the Orrell Billinge Transition Town Group have submitted 
  a proposal to develop a section of Greenslate Farm into a community allotment 
  project that involves local doctors, farmers, schools and residents. The Transition 
  Group requested that the Network provide active support for the proposal from 
  the Cultural Partnership. It was unanimously agreed to do so.</p>
<p>Next Meeting: Monday 5th September - venue details to be forwarded to members 
  shortly.</p>
