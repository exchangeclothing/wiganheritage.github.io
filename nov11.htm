<p>The Chair John O'Neill welcomed everyone to the meeting.</p>
<p>Minutes of previous meeting</p>
<p>Agreed as true and accurate.</p>
<p>Funding News</p>
<p>The Chair informed the meeting about the Community Olympiad Project - Performance 
  Reward Grant. Information had come via the Cultural Partnership. This local 
  fund has &pound;40K still available. Application is through Heritage Services 
  (Carole Tyldesley or Hudson Lo) between 1st November to 3rd January. Categories 
  include Sports, 'wider cultural legacy', 'promoting lasting community and environmental 
  benefit' and 'encouraging volunteering'.</p>
<p>Matters Arising</p>
<p>Hindley Museum - Hindley Library is moving to the Community Centre in First 
  Street, Hindley. The building is being closed which means Hindley Museum upstairs 
  has to close. As a voluntary group, they can't afford the running costs of over 
  &pound;10K per annum, and the building is in need of repair. It is a Grade Two 
  listed building. The Museum are planning to store some of their artefacts in 
  Tudor House. They plan to run an outreach programme next year.</p>
<p>Waterloo Monument - John O'Neill has commissioned a survey of the monument 
  which will essentially 'x-ray' the monument to assess the condition of the metal 
  structure inside. This needs to be done before deciding what work is required 
  to restore the monument.</p>
<p>Boer War Memorial - the fundraising to commission a replica statue to be reinstated 
  on the plinth in Mesnes Park is approaching halfway to the target of approx 
  &pound;40-50K. They are currently running a big raffle to be drawn on 16th December.</p>
<p>Our Heritage DVD - is now available from a range of outlets around the Borough: 
  The Museum of Wigan Life shop, Haigh Hall gift shop, Billinge Post Office, Longshaw 
  Post Office, Orrell Post Office, Leigh Library, Atherton Library, Standish Library 
  (shortly), two shops in Lowton, Astley Green Colliery Museum and from Richard 
  Sivill in Howe Bridge. The DVD has received some publicity in the Wigan Observer, 
  Past Forward and the Wigan Reporter.</p>
<p>Borough in Bloom - Wigan has been chosen to enter the national competition 
  for best Borough. This is as a result of the success and growth of the project 
  in the Borough over recent years. The floral enhancement around war memorials 
  was mentioned, including the idea of removing the decaying tributes a respectful 
  period of time after Remembrance Day.</p>
<p>Greenheart Update</p>
<p>Martin Purcell, project manager, gave an update on Greenheart. Following their 
  photographic competition, Greenheart have produced a 2012 calendar which is 
  available to buy for &pound;3.</p>
<p>Kirkless - Heritage Lottery Fund have awarded approx &pound;50K towards the 
  Kirkless site near Ince, which was formerly the largest iron and steel works 
  in Europe. It is now home to some unusual plants and wild orchids. The project 
  involves educational work and tidying up the site. The plan is to appoint a 
  project officer.</p>
<p>Lightshaw Meadows - the work is mostly completed. It cost around &pound;600K 
  which included more than &pound;500K from Heritage Lottery Fund. There are now 
  Longhorn cattle grazing on the site. Future work will be around interpretation. 
  Meeting will be set for next year. Some members of the Network have indicated 
  that they would like to contribute to this interpretation work. There is planned 
  to be an exhibition at the Museum of Wigan Life in the Spring.</p>
<p>Etherstone Hall - the site within Leigh Sports Village of a former moated manor 
  house has been selected as the first Greater Manchester Big Dig - a project 
  which will stage an archaeological dig in each of the Boroughs of Greater Manchester. 
  There is also the plan to stage a theatrical performance in the Wood there as 
  part of the 2012 Words Festival.</p>
<p>Network Celebration Evening</p>
<p>The Network Celebration Evening at the Museum of Wigan Life last week was well 
  attended - the room was full - and was felt to be a success. There is the idea 
  to run the essay competition again next year, but broaden it out to local schools. 
  It is proposed to stage the event again next year. Peter Goodwin suggested that 
  the event had the potential to be larger and attract members of the public, 
  although it would need a larger room.</p>
<p>Members News</p>
<p>The Chair John O'Neill reported back about the Cultural Partnership Heritage 
  subgroup of the Borough Partnership. The structure of the Borough Partnership 
  is changing. Townships structure is on its way out. Still deciding exactly what 
  replaces it, but likely to focus upon the local elected representatives ie Councillors. 
  Two of the groups born out of the previous structure - the Cultural Partnership 
  and ourselves the Environment and Heritage Network - want to continue to exist.</p>
<p>Roman Dig in Wigan - the public booklet about the Roman Dig on the site of 
  the Grand Arcade has been published and is available for sale. The official 
  academic write-up for the dig - which will be a much longer and detailed work 
  - will cost around &pound;12K to produce. Trying to get the new owners of Grand 
  Arcade to contribute. Original developers who had agreed to fund the archaeological 
  work went bankrupt.</p>
<p>Friends of Wigan Life Museum (chair - Max Finney) are running a Lancashire 
  Day at the Museum of Wigan Life this coming Saturday 26th November.</p>
<p>Leigh Soroptimists are also celebrating Lancashire Day on Monday 28th November 
  with a hot pot supper at Leigh Cricket Club. Avis Freeman also mentioned the 
  ongoing efforts to get bulbs planted on the new roundabout by Leigh Sports Village.</p>
<p>Preston Museum is re-opening on Saturday 26th November. It is next to the prison 
  in Preston. Neil Forsaw reported that it will contain an exhibit about George 
  Formby. The documentary about George Formby presented by Frank Skinner was broadcast 
  recently on BBC 4 and BBC 2.</p>
<p>Dave Wilson reported that the proposed North Leigh development, which will 
  build houses on fields next to Westleigh, is causing controversy.</p>
<p>Glenys McClellan reported that the Leigh United Reform Church in Union Street 
  had closed. It contained a war memorial panel inside that has now been reinstalled 
  and rededicated in the memorial corner in Leigh Parish Church.</p>
<p>Hudson Lo informed the meeting about an email Carole Tyldesley had received 
  from the BBC. They are looking for contributors for 'Nick Knowles Original Features' 
  - people who are restoring old houses with original features.</p>
