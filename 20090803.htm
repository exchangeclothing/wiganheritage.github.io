<p>Minutes last meeting: - True and accurate, passed</p>
<p>Matters arising: Martin Purcell, co-ordinator for the Greenheart Project, will 
  report progress at future meetings </p>
<p>Presentation: Mark Crossfield officer responsible for Brickershaw north was 
  unable to attend to give his presentation but an update would be reported to 
  the next meeting.</p>
<p>Rachel Orme reported on the Heritage Capital Strategy (2009 - 2013).</p>
<p>In 2003 Wigan Council drew-up its first capital strategy for Wigan's heritage 
  assets with a primary purpose of providing a prioritisation of projects from 
  a host of potential large-scale (&pound;50,000+) capital applications to the 
  Heritage Lottery Fund (HLF). The success of that strategy (which had a 2003-2007 
  life-cycle) is outlined in the updated 2009-2013 strategy introduction.</p>
<p>During 2008 Wigan received Priority Area Status from the HLF, which has fostered 
  the HLF's working in partnership with Wigan Council and Wigan Leisure &amp; 
  Culture Trust. These partners are currently working together to support the 
  generation of more potentially successful applications for small-scale grants 
  through their 'Your Heritage Programme' (under &pound;50,000).</p>
<p>However, it was recognised that Wigan still needed to be able to respond to 
  the Heritage Lottery Fund in terms of larger scale projects. In the Spring of 
  2008 relevant staff from Wigan Council, Wigan Leisure &amp; Culture Trust and 
  Wigan &amp; Leigh CVS met to prepare the ground for the HLF priority area work 
  which would commence in 2009, and this group has steered the development of 
  the Heritage Capital Strategy 2009-2013. The group undertook consultation in 
  the summer/autumn of 2008 with local stakeholders, and the outcome of that consultation 
  is presented within the strategy.</p>
<p>The objective of this strategy is to support the prioritisation of large-scale 
  applications (&pound;10,000+) to the various strands of the HLF. The strategy 
  is written with recognition of the more limited resources available to the HLF 
  over the next four years, as well as the rapidly changing economic climate.</p>
<p>Rachel can be contacted for further information, including copies of the strategy, 
  at r.orme@wlct.org</p>
<p>Member's News:</p>
<p>Tom Price (Civic Trust) has been working on the Heritage Open Days (10th - 
  13th September) list and has compiled it for distribution.</p>
<p>Avis Freeman (Leigh Soroptimists) has also been working on the Heritage Open 
  Days list</p>
<p>Jackie Roberts (ETNA) believed that there has been a 60% reduction in the Right 
  Of Ways budget and that Funding for the Bickershaw North project had been withdrawn. 
  Both items to be confirmed at the September meeting.<br>
  <br>
  Ken Barston (Stubshaw Cross Residents Group) reported that the Heritage Gardens 
  are now almost complete after three years work. These gardens would be a good 
  place for the group to visit at a suitable time in the future.</p>
<p>Richard Savill (Atherton Heritage) has been out giving talks to various organisations. 
  His group has been trying to get agreement regarding the placement of a plaque 
  commemorating the Gibfield Colliery Pit Head Baths and believed to be the first 
  of their kind in the industry. </p>
<p>Vince France (ETNA) commented that the Devonshire Sheltered Accommodation does 
  have a commemoration plaque in place. It was named after a ship (a model of 
  which is on display at Leigh Town Hall), as was the practice during the Second 
  World War. He worked at Gibfield Colliery and remembers the pithead baths, whose 
  construction was inspired by an incident with the colliery owner and a miner's 
  wife, who complained about the lack of such a facility </p>
<p>Ann Rampling (Town Green Residents Association) explained how the huge effort 
  that went into creating the community gardens is having beneficial spinoff via 
  school involvement (art, drama, visits etc.) and in bringing the local community 
  together.</p>
<p>Nigel Morley (Wigan Finescale Railway Modellers) reported on his society's 
  show in December to be held at Robin Park. Members are currently doing repair 
  work on a former members layout and interested persons can get information via 
  www.wiganfrm.org.uk</p>
<p>Tom Glover (Wigan Archaeology Society) and society members have been engaged 
  in the search for the ram-pump in Menses Park, which has taken four months to 
  locate and has been a fascinating experience. School children have been involved 
  in the project and many different methods have been tried and tested, including 
  divining rods. The location of the ram-pump has been determined but it remains 
  to be confirmed whether it is still intact and in working order. </p>
<p>Geoff Jones (Astley Green Colliery Museum) has been organising family days 
  at the museum and getting inquiries from schools, both local and from overseas. 
  There was a burglary a little while back that has caused some disruption and 
  inconvenience. Extensions to the railway system are still in progress but he 
  hasn't managed to get the headgear onto the 'buildings at risk' national heritage 
  list yet. Memorial gardens have been installed to commemorate the 100-year aniversery 
  of the Astley Pit Mining Disaster. </p>
<p>Anne Smith (County Bird Recorder) reported that Peregrine Falcons have successfully 
  fledged in Wigan Borough but Ravens unsuccessfully nested at JJB Stadium (the 
  nest was destroyed) and on the old Welley Loop-Line. </p>
<p>Joe Taylor (Billinge History/Heritage Society) reported on the double-decker 
  bus trip organised in conjunction with Community North West that took a group 
  of people to various points of local environment interest around the eastern 
  part of the borough</p>
<p>Local Development Framework Preferred Options - heritage &amp; environment 
  concerns:</p>
<p>The chairman reported on core policies 9, 10, 11 &amp; 12 as the most relevant 
  to the Network and distributed copies of each. Members of the Network had been 
  involved in discussions on 'the historic environment'. The draft core strategy 
  will be published in 2010.</p>
<p>Report from the meeting with the county archaeology officer:</p>
<p>The chair reported on the meeting he had with Norman Redhead, county archaeology 
  officer and others, on the 15 July, to discuss archaeology and heritage issues 
  and other relevant opportunities across the borough.</p>
<p>A copy of the minutes of that meeting will be made available to members shortly.</p>
<p>Environment &amp; Heritage Network Action Plan to 2009 -12:</p>

  on Internet and via Borough Life</p>
