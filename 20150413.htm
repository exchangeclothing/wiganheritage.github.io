<p>Minutes of the last meeting: True and accurate.<br>
  <br>
  Presentation - Mark Champion. Mark reported that:<br>
  The Greenheart team remains strong thanks to input by John and Martin.<br>
  There is a drive for nature improvement schemes in Greater Manchester. The areas 
  abounding the Manchester Ship Canal is receiving attention.<br>
  The post-industrial brown field sites are becoming increasingly important for 
  habitats - willow-tits being a species in particular.<br>
  LWT are developing a &pound;2.2 million bid. Input from the voluntary sector 
  is needed.<br>
  There will be a loss of bird habitat from the proposed road from Marus Bridge 
  to Westwood along the old railway line route.<br>
  Wigan has many small housing developments that could have more impact on biodiversity 
  than one large development.</p>
<p>Other Business:</p>
<p>Ken gave an update on Stubshaw Cross and distributed a booklet about walks 
  in that area.</p>
<p>Trust in Leigh should be aware that there will be an upgrading of paths along 
  the canal at Leigh.</p>
<p>Various proposed developments around the Borough could have an impact of roads 
  and wildlife corridors. </p>
