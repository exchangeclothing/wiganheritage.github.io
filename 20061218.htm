</p>
<p>Tom Glover wished it to be known that excavations in Ince were proving fruitful 
  but did not want the exact location of the site to be published at present.</p>
<p>It was noted that the close proximity to Christmas made attendance at this 
  meeting somewhat difficult but as important matters needed attention, the attendance 
  of those present was greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>Minutes of the last meeting: </p>
<p>Accepted as True and Accurate</p>
<p>Matters Arising: </p>
<p>Wigan Borough Heritage Network now has a website at www.wiganheritage.com designed 
  by Kevin Sutton from Wigan &amp; Leigh CVS. Members are invited to make contributions 
  to the content of this website. Heritage Network is able to maintain and amend 
  the website as required. </p>
<p>Philip Butler will explore the possibility of displaying a gallery of thumbnails 
  of photographs that can be purchased from the archives.</p>
<p>Peter Taylor spoke about the Memorial Trophy for Ashton Arts Festival, mentioned 
  by Glenys McClellan. He corrected the entry to read that the trophy was not 
  'lost' as mentioned, that more trophies from The Ashton Arts Festival were stored 
  by him and the correct name of the trophy was 'The Alf Hughes' Memorial Trophy.</p>
<p></p>
<p><br>
  Constitution:</p>
<p> A draft constitution had been circulated for comment and input prior to the 
  meeting. After further consideration, it was decided that the constitution be 
  accepted for Wigan Borough Heritage Network. An interim management committee 
  was elected until the AGM. John O'Neil will act as the elected member for Wigan 
  MBC and Philip Butler will act as representative for Wigan L&amp;CT. Ray Hutchinson, 
  &amp; Tom Price will act as community representatives together with Joe Taylor, 
  who will act as chair and secretary and Peter Guy, who will act as treasurer. 
</p>
<p>A clause in the constitution enables the constitution to be modified and amended 
  as required. </p>
<p><br>
  Heritage Network, Cultural Partnership and related matters:</p>
<p>At the Cultural Partnership executive meeting, December 4th, Michael Walker 
  presented the paper proposing a Heritage Sub Group to the Cultural Partnership, 
  to address the concerns of all stakeholders in ensuring that the 'voice' of 
  Heritage is heard by the Cultural Partnership, while ensuring that this voice 
  is fully representative of all those involved in the celebration and promotion 
  of heritage in Wigan. </p>
<p>The Cultural Partnership Execute, who supported the initiative and congratulated 
  the Heritage related organisations for their input and commitment, welcomed 
  this proposal.</p>
<p>The stage is now set for attention to be focused on Heritage related issues 
  across the Borough, starting early next year and continuing into the foreseeable 
  future.</p>
<p>Building Conservation Strategy: </p>
<p>Jason Kennedy reported on the progress made in developing the building conservation 
  strategy, which should be ready for consultation by February. Heritage Network 
  will assist with the consultation process. Civic Trust is an organisation particularly 
  interested with building conservation.</p>
<p>Jason distributed a Character Appraisal for Green Hill Conservation Area and 
  a Comments Form.</p>
<p>John O'Neill spoke about the commendable thoroughness of the Conservation Area 
  report for Standish, which can be downloaded from the Council website.</p>
<p>Township/CEP approach to Heritage Visioning:</p>
<p>Emma Scott outlined a proposed strategy to involve residents in identifying 
  items of heritage significance. The Borough Wide Community Network is considering 
  holding its meetings for the coming year in the individual Townships, in sequence 
  with the Township Forum meetings, with a quiz and a short presentation about 
  heritage as a topic. John Hesketh spoke about the need to align heritage mapping/visioning 
  work led by CEP with front-line activity proposed in the Cultural Partnership 
  Work Programme for 2007.</p>
<p>It was agreed that L&amp;CT and Community Empowerment Programme would meet 
  January 4th to discuss tactics and report back to the members.</p>
