<p>Hamish Jeffreson brought the meeting up to date with developments on the Birckershaw 
  Project. The memorial for miners killed in the 1931 tragedy is on the back burner 
  for now as no volunteer group has as yet been established and the trust can 
  not apply for funding. Input from our network has helped establish various walks 
  have been arranged. For details of dates contact Hamish on hjeffreson@lancswt.org.uk 
  One thousand five hundred trees have been planted and a similar number will 
  be planted on the 7th and 15th of March. The wetland development has been approved.</p>
<p>A discussion then took place with Hamish and members regarding the Bickershaw 
  Project. David Shallcross gave input regarding birds.</p>
<p>Hamish agreed to keep the Network informed regarding future developments.</p>
<p>Barney Frances from the Peterloo Memorial Project sent apologies and will come 
  to speak at a future meeting.</p>
<p>Members Reports: </p>
<p>Joe Taylor: The Association of Greater Manchester Trade Union Councils are 
  considering promoting Peterloo and things related as a major topic. Funding 
  has been secured to develop the memorial garden and is now in progress. </p>
<p>David Shallcross: L.O.S has written to the planning department regarding Swift, 
  Martin, and bat boxes reminding them of the presentation&nbsp;I gave to them 
  in there offices 18 months ago.<br>
  To date as far as we can see no new build or renovation projects have included 
  any of our proposals, despite many positive comments on the day.</p>
<p>A volunteer&nbsp;group for Pennington Flash which was set up 15months ago is 
  growing in numbers and has carried out many successful&nbsp;projects around 
  the Flash, it has received&nbsp;a grant from &quot;The Deal&quot; and a donation
