  Presentation by Mark Champion from Lancashire Wildlife Trust on 'Operations 
  in Wigan's Greenheart':</p>
<p>Most of the sites that LWT are working on in Greenheart are post-industrial 
  with urban problems of spoil and misuse (motorbikes etc)<br>
  Mark has been at LWT for over ten years and in that time the organisation has 
  achieved significant restoration success<br>
  Reedbed restoration at Wigan Flashes has removed 2.8 million tonnes of post-industrial 
  spoil, created 12km of ditches &amp; paths, 35 hectares of new reedbed and restored 
  another 40 hectares.<br>
  The flashes were created suddenly by deliberate subsidence approximately 100 
  years ago, but are now an important reedbed wetland<br>
  Wildlife supported includes Bitterns, Perch &amp; Rud, Water Voles, Willow Tits 
  and Orchids.<br>
  The flashes have 12km of footpaths, attracting 97,000 visits per year. The work 
  utilises 600 volunteer days per year, and has helped at least 11 people into 
  employment. 15 schools per year are involved in projects.<br>
  The flashes comprise 1% of the UK's freshwater reedbed, providing habitat for 
  1.5% of British Bitterns, 1% of Reed Warblers, c. 1% of Water Rails, and 1% 
  of breeding Pochard and Gadwall.<br>
  LWT also manages mosslands in the North West including 40 hectares in Wigan.<br>
  LWT has just purchased Abram Flash.<br>
  LWT has got a 'Strategic Level Agreement' with Wigan Leisure and Culture Trust 
  to support 3 new Local Nature Reserve designations - Greenslate LNR (which is 
  a section of Orrell Water Park), Low Hall LNR, and Three Sisters wetland.<br>
  Three Sisters wetland was recently opened by David Bellamy (see current Borough 
  Life magazine) and contains 8 hectares of 'controllable water levels'.<br>
  Lightshaw Meadows has now been purchased - this is a partnership with Red Rose 
  Forest.<br>
  In summary 'Wild Wigan&#133;A Lovely Place to Visit.'</p>
<p>Minutes of Last Meeting (8th March 2010)</p>
<p>John O'Neil talked through highlights of last meeting's minutes. There were 
  no corrections.</p>
<p>Matters Arising - none</p>
<p>Greenheart Community Forum nominations.</p>
<p>It had been decided at the last meeting that this meeting had to finalise Greenheart 
  Community Forum nominations from the Environment &amp; Heritage Network. John 
  O'Neil pointed out that there would also be community representatives from the 
  BioDiversity Group.</p>
<p>Dave Wilson stated that he would like to be a community representative but 
  would be nominated through the Bio Diversity Group.</p>
<p>There were four nominations from the meeting with one place still to be decided.<br>
  Three people in the meeting volunteered:<br>
  Jackie Roberts (Bridleways)<br>
  Avis Freeman (Leigh Soroptimists)<br>
  Tony Bishop (Leigh Ornithological Society)<br>
  And Joe Taylor (Billinge History/Heritage Society) was nominated in his absence.</p>
<p>A Wigan Heritage DVD - Peter Goodwin</p>
<p>A paper had been circulated to the Network about the idea of making a DVD for 
  sale to the public about Wigan Heritage. Peter Goodwin from Mirabilis Media 
  briefly explained that the idea was not to make a definitive film about the 
  history of Wigan, but was to feature a selection of short items from across 
  the Wigan Borough highlighting buildings and aspects of local history. The DVD 
  did not have any grant money, so the idea was that funding for the DVD production 
  would be brought in through sales of the DVD. If possible, there would be a 
  'story' from each of the ten townships in the Borough. The DVD would help publicise 
  the importance of heritage in the Borough, highlight the work of the BLINT list 
  and help promote the Environment and Heritage Network and its members. Members 
  were invited to be involved in the planning if they wished and the meeting was 
  asked for its comments. </p>
<p>The response seemed favourable, with no objections and quite a few ideas for 
  inclusion in the DVD. Suggestions for consideration included: musical heritage 
  - brass bands &amp; male voice choirs; the 3 towns; Marsh Gymnasium; listed 
  organ at Leigh church; Lane Head chapel which is shutting in May; Atherton Nativity; 
  Roman Invasion project to be staged in September; Ashton Arts Festival; Chowbent 
  Unitarian Chapel in Atherton.</p>
<p>John O'Neill confirmed that he will help. Richard Sivill expressed his interest 
  in being involved. Geoff Jones stated that the film crew were 'free to come 
  anytime' to Astley Green Colliery Museum. Peter Goodwin gave out his phone number 
  07968 178 211 so that people could phone him with ideas in the future.</p>
<p>Network News</p>
<p>John O'Neill reported on the opening of the Museum of Wigan Life - formerly 
  the History Shop. John and Tom Price had spoken with Yvonne Webb about a plaque 
  dedicated to Fred Holcroft in the Museum and agreed where is should be displayed. 
</p>
<p>It was suggested that the Network might visit Hindley Museum, situated above 
  Hindley Library, as its next field trip. It would give an opportunity to learn 
  about the running of a small local museum. </p>
<p>The 2010 Wigan Cultural Partnership Convention has been arranged for Saturday 
  10th July at Formby Hall in Atherton.</p>
<p>Lightshaw Meadows - the Heritage Lottery have awarded a grant of &pound;500,000.</p>
<p>Wigan Boys and Girls Club - the application to build on Mesnes Field has been 
  approved.</p>
<p>Hesketh Arms pub in Shevington - was under threat but has now been listed as 
  Grade II on Thursday 27th January 2010.</p>
<p>Members News</p>
<p>Richard Sivill (Atherton Heritage) spoke about the Pithead Baths at Gidlow.</p>
<p>Geoff Jones (Astley Green Colliery Museum) reported back about the recent visitors 
  to the Museum who have included schools from St Helens, visiting French students, 
  Greater Manchester mayors and Marishi school students from Skelmersdale. The 
  Museum are continuing with the work on the railway line. The restoration of 
  the winding gear is nearing completion.</p>
<p>Avis Freeman (Leigh Soroptimists) reported that the Leigh Girls Grammar School 
  is now totally demolished. She spoke about the history of Lowton Civic Hall 
  and the threat to that building.</p>
<p>Neil Forshaw (George Formby Society) reported that an independent TV production 
  company Liberty Bell had filmed a programme 'Frank Skinner on Formby' which 
  is due to be broadcast in May on BBC4.</p>
<p>Tom Glover (Discovery Group) explained that the Discovery Group was soon to 
  have its second AGM. Tom offered training to other groups in using the Discovery 
  Group's resistivity equipment. The Group has now completed its recent project 
  in Mesnes Park and Tom offered that the Discovery Group could do a presentation 
  about the project to a future Network meeting. The Discovery Group has been 
  appointed as archaeological diggers for Wigan Leisure and Culture Trust when 
  required. A member of the Discovery Group recently found a shard of flint in 
  the Leigh area which is thought to be thousands of years old and is creating 
  considerable interest.</p>
<p>Any Other Business - none</p>
<p>Next Meeting - is the Network AGM on Monday 24th May 10.30am at Tudor House.</p>
