<p>Members Reports: (to be inserted)</p>
<p>L.O.S. report to the meeting:-&nbsp;<br>
  1.there are concerns that the Pennington Flash User Group meeting hadn't taken 
  place for many months and despite contact with Mr G Workman WLCT no progress 
  had been made, with regards to a private meeting to discus habitat works being 
  carried out at this time.<br>
  2.For the groups information, the society is in consultation with &quot;Trust 
  in Leigh&quot; on their proposed plans to upgrade nature related footpaths in 
  the Leigh area, the society is to ask for &quot;Trust in Leigh&quot; to be on 
  the agenda at the next Greenheart Forum Meeting, because of conflicting or duplication 
  of interest and work<br>
  3.If any of the groups members would like an email copy of the LOS's bi-monthly 
  Newsletter, let David know and arrangements can be made for them to be sent 
  F.O.C. send an email to David requesting one: chairman@leighos.org.uk&nbsp;<br>
