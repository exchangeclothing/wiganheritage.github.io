Matters discussed<br>
These were mostly about the council&#146;s future plans and how the network can 
keep in touch and help implement them.<br>
Alison told us <br>
In September 2018 the council started asking what people want over the next 10 
years what are their priorities? The key things were pride in towns and villages, 
making vibrant town centres, culture, heritage and leisure. <br>
A cultural manifesto has been drawn up to launch in May which is a 5 year plan. 
A bid has gone to the Arts Council for projects. <br>
There is to be an Environment officer<br>
The council needs to link with us more, we agreed to have a workshop, instead 
of one of our meetings or as an extra, with some of the officers.<br>
Eileen said we need an information office in a central place for visitors and 
locals.<br>
