<p>Minutes of the last meeting - true and accurate.</p>
<p>Matters arising: </p>
<p>Hindley Museum</p>
<p>A letter from Jack Topping concerning the future of the museum following the 
  planned closure of Hindley Library, which houses the museum, appears to leading 
  to it's closure. A special meeting has been called for the 14th of November 
  to discuss the matter. </p>
<p>Waterloo Monument:</p>
<p>John O'Neil has been with a structural engineer to look at the Waterloo Memorial 
  at Bispham Hall, who advised further investigation by a specialised company 
  from Warrington. John is perusing that option in view of the 200th anniversary 
  of the battle.</p>
<p>Tom Price reported that the Heritage Open days, 8th - 11th September - were 
  bigger and better than ever</p>
<p>The Network celebration day, 17th November, will start 6.00 with refreshments. 
  Members are requested to be there and to get people to attend. The result of 
  the essay competition will be announced on the night. Jason Kennedy will give 
  a presentation and Martin Purcell will show the latest Greenheart DVD, followed 
  by displays of members' work and the handing out of certificates of membership 
  to local societies.</p>
<p>Announcements:</p>
<p>Tom brought the meeting up to date with progress on the restoration of the 
  Boer War memorial in Mesnes Park and the involvement of the Territorial Army 
  in the project.</p>
<p>John Hill reported that about 70 people attended this year's Cultural Partnership 
  Convention, centered around the Olympic Games as this year's awards for children 
  and young people.</p>
<p>The results of the proposed restructure on the LSP have not been announced 
  yet but it is expected that the Cultural Partnership will continue to exist 
  in some form.</p>
<p>The Network's DVD night was a success. The costs of production have to be recovered 
  and any help in distributing the DVD will, of course, be appreciated.</p>
<p>Our Local Heritage Sites:</p>
<p>Damien Jenkinson spoke about various projects that are occurring, including 
  Britton Tidy's, 'Love Where You Are' which entails King Street and surrounding 
  areas not being cleaned for a week so that people are confronted with the results 
  of casually discarded litter. He handed out a list of the monuments that are 
  linked to the 'In Bloom' initiative and agreed with the chairman's suggestion 
  that a prize might be given to the monuments that are best florally enhanced. 
  There were 17 entrants to North West in Bloom this year and the council's Big 
  Thank You will be held 1st November. The sowing of wild flowers at roundabouts 
  in Bolton has been appreciated by locals and will be considered for Wigan. Damien 
  pointed out that the purpose of the In Bloom project is to get people involved 
  in looking after their neighborhoods and in that regard it has been very successful.</p>
<p>Proposed Workshop Exercise:</p>
<p>Jason Kennedy has agreed to run a workshop with us sometime in 2012 that can 
  be used as a model for local community groups.</p>
<p>Business Items:</p>
<p>Jan wondered if anyone knows someone who can play spoons or bones for a proect 
  she is doing with pensioners and children.<br>
  Avis reported that a Pennington - Bedford boundary stone had been dumped in 
  Ince and should be restored..<br>
  Neil informed the meeting that on BBC 4 at 9 pm on the 27th of October there 
  is a program about George Formby.<br>
