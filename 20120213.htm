<p>Matters Arising: </p>
<p>Kirkless (off top lock) one of the biggest Irion &amp; Steel works in Europe 
  was closed in the 1920's. The limestone deposits have helped the development 
  of the local flora and fauna. HLF have granted &pound;50,000 to improve the 
  site. Mark Champion, who will attend the next meeting, will head the project. 
  It is hoped that a 'friends' group can be set up - maybe the archeological society 
  could get involved to show the exact extent of the original structure, which 
  is obscure now. </p>
<p>The Olympic Torch will be in Wigan on the 31st of May, scheduled to arrive 
  in Lowton at 3.15 then pass though Abram, Wigan, Scholes, Ince and Hindley and 
  leaves around 5.30. The community Olympiad bids will be agreed on the 29th February 
  2012.</p>
<p>The GM Big Dig at Etherstone Hall (Leigh Sports Village) will start in March 
  and be directed by Salford University. They want people to get involved and 
  ten local school classes have already signed up to participate.</p>
<p>The Wigan Townscape Heritage Initiative is almost finished. Work on the station 
  has started, trees will be planted and money has been allocated to improve listed 
  buildings.</p>
<p>The Cultural Partnership is to continue with terms to be agreed at the AGM 
  in September. </p>
<p>Glenys McClellan went to the first of three sessions on progress with the Red 
  Rose Forest project at Lightshaw Meadows and reported that: trees have been 
  planted; pathways and drainage have been improved and the next tree planting 
  will occur next winter. The cattle are doing a good job of keeping the vegetation 
  under control. Tony Bishop of Leigh Ornithological Society has walked round 
  the area and was very impressed.</p>
