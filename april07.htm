<p><b>Present: </b></p>
<p>Joe Taylor &amp; Louis Baker (Billinge History/Heritage Society), Emma Scott 
  (Community Empowerment Programme), Tom Price &amp; Peter Taylor (Civic Trust), 
  Philip Butler, John Hesketh &amp; Michael Walker (L&amp;CT), Jason Kennedy (Conservation

<p><b>Apologies: </b></p>
<p>Peter Guy (Gin Pit Village), Glenys McClellan (Leigh FHS/Wigan Registry Office)</p>
<p><b>Welcome:</b> </p>
<p>Iain Hodcroft attending Heritage Network for the first time as a result of 
  reading the article in Past Forward Issue No 45 </p>
<p><b>Minutes of Last Meeting</b>: </p>
<p>Accepted as true and accurate</p>
<p><b>Matters Arising</b>:</p>
<p>Fred Holcroft has sadly died. The representatives from L&amp;CT will inquire 
  about a suitable place for a memorial plaque to be situated, the representatives 
  from Civic Trust will draft the appropriate wording and the representatives 
  from Billinge History/Heritage Society will inquire about getting the plaque 
  made.</p>
<p>Since David Heyes, Address Manager for Council, attended the last meeting, 
  his department has forwarded the proposed names for new streets to the Heritage 
  Network for comment.<br>
  <br>
  Philip Butler informed the meeting that we are welcome to submit an article 
  from the Heritage Network for the next edition of Past Forward.</p>

  Conservation Officer: </b></p>
<p>Jason Kennedy reported that he is almost ready to start the process of updating 
  the list of Buildings Of Local Importance, a project that Heritage Network can 
  assist with. He will begin the Character Appraisal for Tyldesley Conservation 
  Area next year and is working on the four Conservation Areas in Leigh, all at 
  the same time. </p>
<p><b>Heritage Network Representation on Partnerships:</b></p>
<p>Joe Taylor attended a meeting of the Environment and Development Partnership 
  as a guest representing the Heritage Network. There are nine Community Networks 
  and the method by which representatives from these Networks are elected to the 
  Wigan Borough Partnership and the Thematic Partnerships is now under review. 
  We would expect to have representation from Heritage Network on the WPB and 
  appropriate Thematic Partnerships. Michael Walker reported that the Heritage 
  sub-group of the Cultural Partnership would meet for the first time in the near 
  future.</p>
<p><b>The DVD Project and Education</b>:</p>
<p>John Hesketh updated on the DVD/Resource Pack Project advising Network colleagues 
  on a presentation that he and Joe had given to Secondary Heads of History at 
  the Professional Development Centre earlier that morning. He explained that 
  in outlining the Network's aspirations to work alongside teachers, children 
  &amp; young people alike towards the creation of new learning materials focused 
  on elements of the Borough's social history their aim was to generate expressions 
  of interest; to broker new links on which working partnerships could be built 
  with a view to enriching the learning experience schools are able to offer at 
  Key Stage 3 - in Citizenship, History, ICT, Media and PSHE&amp;C. From his point 
  of view the session had been very worthwhile and he looked forward to starting 
  on the detailed planning work that the project required with external funding 
  bids in focus.</p>
<p><b>Cultural Partnership Convention: </b></p>
<p>John responded to enquiry about the event, noting that it would bring together 
  members of the Partnership, officers of the Leisure &amp; Culture Trust, those 
  involved in consultation on the new Cultural Manifesto for Wigan Borough, stakeholders 
  from across the cultural sector and interested members of the public to celebrate 
  the Borough's cultural offer and look forward - shaping foundation work plans 
  for the future, energising towards and mobilising behind work towards the over-arching, 
  locally-grown vision for development through 2012. More particularly, he noted, 
  it would provide delegates with opportunities to learn more about cultural activity 
  and opportunity through display stands, film, literature and performance over 
  a light breakfast; review Wigan's new Cultural Manifesto and the Partnership's 
  associated film: Cultural Vibrancy: A CV for a Brighter Borough; reflect on 
  the Cultural Partnership's work since 1999/2000; consider lessons to be learned 
  going forward as the Northern Soul Cultural Strategy is left behind and the 
  Manifesto embraced, the need of cultural interventions at neighbourhood level 
  as well as Borough-wide improvement works and project activity; contribute to 
  forward planning - looking afresh at the Partnership's constitution, membership 
  and possible worth in an advisory group, priorities requiring its attention 
  and needing to form the basis of its medium-term work programme mindful of the 
  Chair's due retirement next year; end on a very positive note as the Arts Factor, 
  SHAPE and formative Heritage Strategies are launched (through short presentations 
  in highlight of what we can confidently look forward to in three different and 
  distinct fields) and our key note speaker, Gerri Moriarty, concludes in affirmation 
  of works in Wigan (community/voluntary and public) and encouragement towards 
  take-up on a rich wealth of opportunities through 2012 as the country's culture 
  comes to the fore with the London Olympic Games drawing ever nearer.</p>
<p>All were invited to attend, but informed that they would first need to reserve 
  their place by contacting John on Wigan 486916.</p>
<p><b>Townships/CEP Approach to Heritage Visioning: </b></p>
<p>Emma Scott, coordinator for CEP, reported that the last meeting of the Borough 
  Wide Community Network was held at Lowton. A report on Golborne and Lowton Heritage 
  has been sent in from John Maconie of Golborne History Society and was circulated. 
  Iain Hodcroft is willing to look at heritage in Tyldesley. The next BWCN meeting 
  in Orrell will be the fifth of the ten scheduled around the townships. By the 
  time the cycle is completed, we should have a fair indication of who will be 
  able to help with our project of defining heritage across the Borough and to 
  whom we might direct funding support.</p>
<p><b>Other Business:</b></p>
<p>Tom Price gave a detailed report on the history and activities of the Wigan 
  Civic Trust.</p>
