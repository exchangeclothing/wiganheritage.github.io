<p>Minutes of the last meeting: Accepted as a true record.</p>
<p>Matters Arising:</p>
<p>No news from Alex yet re archives.</p>
<p>Members News and Reports:</p>
<p>Mary Pennington distributed the latest Archaeology Society newsletters. Due 
  to the recent wet conditions they have not been digging but have had access 
  to the rectory cellars and she suggested we might consider a visit some time 
  in the future.</p>
<p>Peter Goodwin is not currently working on a heritage related project in Wigan 
  but is doing so in Liverpool.</p>
<p>Joe Taylor updated on events happening at Greenslate Community Farm.<br>
  <br>
  Peter Fleetwood and his friends are developing their website and have adopted 
  the Plantation Gates in Wigan Lane as a restoration project. A condition survey 
  is under way. They are also helping the cricket club with heritage related matters.</p>
<p>Lynda Jackson reported that Drumcroon paintings are on display at the Turnpike 
  Gallery in Leigh. The Egyptian exhibition will continue until June 2nd. A new 
  group is using Trencherfield Mill for various heritage related events. The school 
  program is under review due to changes in the curriculum and various exhibitions 
  are planned at the museum over the coming year.</p>
<p>John O&#146;Neil and others from Greenheart have been working with Trust In 
  Leigh to target heritage areas that need upgrading thanks for funding obtained 
  from The Deal. They hope to meet specifications for the Engaging Communities 
  program as a path to future funding by relating the heritage areas upgrading 
  to specific health initiatives relating to the borough&#146;s poor health indices. 
</p>
<p>Avis Freeman and friends from Leigh Soroptimists planted bulbs along the canal 
  at Leigh but due to the poor condition of the ground it wasn&#146;t very successful. 
  The restoration of Leigh Spinners continues after a successful funding bit to 
  restore the engine house. This is one part of a 10 year plan. Avis will investigate 
  the possibility of a visit.</p>
<p>Avis thanked everyone for attending and closed the meeting.</p>
<p>Date next meeting: Monday 27th June 2016. <br>
