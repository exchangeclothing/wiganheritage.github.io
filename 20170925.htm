<p>Presentation: by Hamish Jeffreson:</p>
<p>Hamish is overseeing the three year Bickershaw Project, started this May, funded 
  by Council via &#145;The Deal&#146;. Eventually it is planned that the community 
  take over management. Part of the project will be to erect a memorial to those 
  lives lost in the 1932 Bickershaw mining disaster. When time comes to bid for 
  funding for that memorial, it will help if community organisations support the 
  bid. Hamish was assured that when time comes he will get support from the E&amp;H 
  Network.</p>
<p>There was a lengthy discussion about the project and Hamish answered questions 
  related to it.</p>
<p>Members Reports:</p>
<p>Joe Taylor: </p>
<p>It has been proposed that the plot of land the Network now manages adjacent 
  to Greenslate Community Farm be converted to a memorial garden dedicated to 
  the schoolgirl from Winstanley college who was recently murdered in Orrell Water 
  Park. Wigan CEO, Donna Hall, has expressed support for this project. The Network 
  secretary has met with relevant Council staff (including Lynn Calderbank nee 
  Kay who recently gave us a presentation regarding asset transfer) and the headmistress 
  at Winstanley College. </p>
<p>An application is now being developed to coincide with the latest round of 
  funding for &#145;The Deal&#146;. It requires an organisation with a constitution 
  and bank account to administer any funding so granted. It was agreed unanimously 
  the E&amp;H Network are happy to administer any funding allocated for this project.</p>
<p>Richard Sivill:</p>
<p>Formby Hall<br>
  This hall was built for the community by the Coal Company Fletcher-Burrows and 
  was given to the Atherton UDC. WMC sold it to a private company who have now 
  sold the plot for private development. Despite local protests the hall has now 
  been demolished.</p>
<p>Housing Development Howe Bridge<br>
  WMC Planning Department will hold a public meeting, shortly, about a planning 
  application to build a further 830 houses on farm land between Howe Bridge and 
  Tyldesley, this in addition to the 250 now under construction. The impact on 
  the environment and the village will be significant.</p>
