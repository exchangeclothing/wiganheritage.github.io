  The Chair, welcomed everyone to the meeting</p>
<p>Announcements:</p>
<p>The Cultural Partnership is in the process of re-structure and change. There's 
  an executive meeting 23 September to consider details.</p>
<p>John O'Neill is trying to get a quote for the necessary refurbishment of the 
  Waterloo Memorial so that a grant application can be made. The Scouts Association, 
  who hold the land rights, have no objections providing there is no cost to them.</p>
<p>The future of Haigh Hall depends on a private company being willing to take 
  a lease in the next 12 months or so</p>
<p>The format for interpretation boards at Lightshaw Meadows has been agreed.</p>
<p>Minutes of the last meeting: True and accurate.</p>
<p>Matters arising: None </p>
<p>Linda Jackson, the newly appointed community history manager, introduced herself 
  and gave a brief outline of her previous experience and future aspirations. 
</p>
<p>On the 19th of July the Rugby League World Cup will be on display at the MOFWL 
  and there will be a Rugby League exhibition later this year.</p>
<p>The borough's artefacts are stored in five locations. It is hoped that in future 
  they can be stored in one location with better access and facilities.</p>
<p>Richard Sivill welcomed Linda to Wigan and explained that from a community 
  group perspective it is difficult to find anyone within Council who has any 
  interest or responsibility for Heritage and that there is a lot to be done in 
  this regard. </p>
<p>Members' reports: </p>
<p>Members who wish for reports to be included in the minutes will send in those 
  reports digitally to the secretary.</p>
<p>Astley Green Colliery Museum- Report to the Environment and Heritage Network 
  1st July 2013.</p>
<p>The Structural Survey of the Headgear is now complete and paid for with thanks 
  to English Heritage and Wigan Council's Small Grants. The estimated cost for 
  repairs and ongoing conservation is &pound;350,000, although with all the caveats 
  in the report, &pound;500,000 will probably be nearer the mark. A meeting with 
  Rebecca Mason from HLF and Linda Jackson from W.L. &amp; C T is planned for 
  1st August. The results from the meeting will decide where we go from here. 
  If we take the HLF route then I plan a media appeal to obtain matched funding. 
  The museum is the only physical evidence, apart from landscaped pit rucks, of 
  a former mammoth industry in Lancashire and Cheshire.</p>
<p>We have recently taken delivery of a container to store our paint stocks safely. 
  This will prevent any potential fires from spreading amongst the paints and 
  solvents.<br>
  We have recently suffered several plant equipment failures all of which have 
  been remedied or are nearing repair completion. The most serious problem was 
  total disintegration of a generator switch. The switch was of Austrian origin 
  and Sherlock Holmes couldn't have done a better job of finding another. Unfortunately 
  without the generator we could not power up the two compressors necessary to 
  operate the Winding Engine. Things should be back to normal shortly, with everything 
  crossed!<br>
  School and educational visits, plus outreach activities, continue to grow and 
  we like to think that visitors leave us with a far greater perception of coal 
  mining from the earliest days to the present.</p>
<p>As all you gardeners know the recent weather has been a godsend for weeds and 
  grass to explode into life. We think we have misplaced a couple of our members 
  on the site but will need to climb a tree to see if they are lost in the undergrowth 
  and wandering aimlessly about the place. We keep leaving food for them but to 
  no avail as yet.<br>
  Perhaps the greatest, latest, threat to our existence has recently come to haunt 
  us. We enquired with United Utilities about our water bills, which in truth 
  had been over valued and we had been paying too much for a number of years. 
  We will get some of the money back but then the bombshell that the Government 
  has now allowed utility firms to charge a levy based on ground acreage and therefore 
  water collection. As we have a substantial acreage, United Utilities want to 
  charge us &pound;2,000 annually. Scouts, Guides, and Community Centres appear 
  to be exempt, but an appeal on our part drew a blank. We have placed the matter 
  both with our local Councillors and Andy Burnham and await an outcome. With 
  that sort of fee hanging over us, we will have to seriously consider our future 
  if we do not obtain an alleviation.</p>
<p>Other business:</p>
<p>Leigh Ornithology Society are visiting schools and organising walks as part 
  of their 'young birdies' programme.</p>
<p>Future meetings: </p>
<p>It was proposed that future meeting dates could be 12th August, 4th November, 
  16th December, 27th January, 10th March, 28th April, 2nd June, and 14th July<br>

<p>AGM:</p>
<p>Minutes last AGM: True and accurate</p>
<p>Chairperson's report:</p>
<p>John O'Neill, the retiring chairperson, thanked members and council officers, 
  particularly Martin Purcell and Mark Champion, for their contributions throughout 
  the year.</p>
<p>He expressed sadness at the loss of those officers with which we have built 
  productive relationships with over the years, including John Hill, Carol Tyldesley, 
  Jason Kennedy and Yvonne Webb.</p>
<p>He thanked Peter Goodwin for his work and support in relation to the Heritage 
  DVDs he has produced over the years and informed the meeting that he intends 
  to continue sponsoring the annual Essay Competition and Celebration Evening.</p>
<p>He mentioned the partnerships and bodies we have a presence on and the new 
  ones, such as Youth Zone, that we could support in future.</p>
<p>He expressed his opinion that in the future we need to identify how best to 
  interpret the Borough's Heritage and Environment stories and to perhaps consider 
  the possibility of further DVDs.</p>
<p>John concluded by thanking everyone present for the personal support they have 
  given him in his term as chair of the network.</p>
<p>Avis Freeman presented John with a card and a small present as a token of our 
  thanks for his contributions to the network over the years.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Avis took over as chair of the meeting.</p>
<p>There then ensued a discussion concerning the future and purpose of the network 
  in the current climate of austerity, community engagement staff redundancies, 
  cuts to Council budgets, and the scrapping of the Local Area Agreement system 
  and the Duty to Involve.</p>
<p>It was decided that members should meet as soon as practical to have a private 
  meeting concerning the future of the network.</p>
<p>Two dates were suggested, Monday July 29 or August 5, to be held in the Discovery 
  Room at the Museum of Wigan life, starting at 10.30, subject to availability 
  and members consent.</p>
