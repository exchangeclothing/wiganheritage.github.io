<h2>Climate change Manager Wigan Council</h2>
<p>Kerrell Walley (KW) Wigan Council Climate Change Manager. Apologies for the last-minute update but I will not be able to attend the meeting today due to a conflicting schedule and picking up several projects to support colleagues on annual leave. Please could you let me know if there are any questions that the group would like me to answer in time for the next session? 
<p>One thing I would highlight to the Network is that we now have a monthly climate column in the Wigan Observer and the first is out this week – this begins the Council’s wider platform to discuss climate in everyday conversation.

  <h2>Linda Graham<br><small>Lowton West Residents/The Voice Lowton & Golborne</small></h2>
<p>Re Places for Everyone, much concern right across Lowton re the proposed Pocket Nook development in the plan. The farmer has insisted for over 10 years that he does not want to sell the land included in the proposals, which his family have farmed for three generations, and there are fears that compulsory purchase may be used.

<p>HS2 - I attended the latest community information event re the Golborne Spur in Culcheth on 9th July. Event seemed to be poorly attended plus there has recently been press speculation as to the viability of the Spur.

<p>Byrom Hall Wood - new Ranger appointed by Forestry England - also did 'walk round' with local Councillors re installation of new litter bin at the Slag Lane exit.
<p>Golborne in Bloom - excellent voluntary group which entered Northwest in Bloom for the first time this year. Judging took place on 4th August - result awaited.
<h2>George Formby Society</h2>
<p>Neil Forshaw reported that although they had not been any events, the Society was doing good. They attended Haydock racecourse, but event was flooded due to recent rainfall.
<h2>Leigh Ornithological Society</h2>
<p>New ranger at Bickershaw park. 50th anniversary LOS like to publicise to members of the group about the LOS celebration event for our 50th anniversary and the QAVS award which we hope they find time to attend. 
<p>It's at Leigh library Saturday 9 October 10am -3 pm with the award being presented at 11 am. Lots of dignitaries attending and many environmental organisations displaying. Should be quite a do.
<h3>LOS - Places for everyone</h3>
<p>Noted from Leigh Journal that Wigan council have approved the successor to the Greater Manchester Spatial Framework ( GMSF). it is to build 600 houses at Pocket Nook (Lowton), 1100 house at Mosley Common and 500 West of Gibfield (north end of Atherleigh Way)., and 15000m2 of employment floor space at Pocket Nook and 45000m2 West of Gibfield. Bolton council will also build houses there. There is a consultation period beginning on 9 August on what is called 'Places for Everyone'
<p>Just a reminder that these developments are in addition to the already approved Leigh North (1800 houses). It’s between the bypass and Hindley Green, Atherton South (C600 houses) and phase 1 of Pocket nook (C550 houses) and the Westleigh Waterfront, which has outline planning approval for 550 houses.
<p>I've been protesting about this, along with colleagues from Leigh ornithological society. for a while but this has gone unheard, The loss of Greenspace, high pollution levels from transport and gas boilers, loss of wildlife habitats and corridors, massive traffic congestion on Atherleigh Way but also at Lane Head and the East Lancs Road into Manchester, insufficient school places and medical facilities. The disproportionate treatment of the Leigh constituency beggars belief. 
<p>LOS will invite a representative to the next meeting to get feedback.
<h2>CRESS Eco Architecture</h2>
<p>We are advancing a series of complimentary plans that set a path within an overall strategy that once implemented will develop a higher economic value and lower carbon visitor economy one of these ways is via our CLOTHING EXCHANGE SHOP. The aim is giving locals the opportunity exchange designer second-hand clothing, enabling people to swap their clothes with one another if they wish. Clothes handed into shop receive an Eco token in exchange that can be used as full or part payment on other items. Instead of buying brand new clothes, it encourages everyone to purchase and swap items to help the environment each purchase will be a minimum of £1.00 & then rest can be via tokens. You must exchange clothing if no clothes to exchange a £15.00 minimum price per item will be implemented, there will be a R&D section in shop encouraging young designers to re-purpose the clothing with their creativity. Will look at ways of stopping clothing going to landfill by using them for other purpose.
<h2>Greenslate Community Farm</h2>
<p><b>The Memorial Garden now has another ‘little library’ erected.
<p>The farm is open to the public and the cafe is open for business Wednesday - Saturday.</b>
<h2>Future Meetings</h2>
<p><b>Date of Next Meeting</b>: 13th September 2021 via zoom Leigh town hall can facilitate there from 11th October 2021
