<p>Minutes Last Meeting: </p>
<p>Accepted as true and accurate.</p>
<p>Matters Arising:</p>
<p>The chair reported on progress with the re-vamp of the Township Forums. A series 
  of meetings has been held and an analysis of those meetings will be compiled 
  into a report that will be submitted to Cabinet in July for a decision that 
  will probably be announced in autumn.</p>
<p>Future heritage projects and awards are planned to involve primary schools 
  and an open essay competition, based on local people, places and things will 
  be arranged with the best being published in Past Forward.</p>
<p>Heritage Open Days will be held in September organised by the Lesure Trust 
  and Wigan Civic Trust. </p>
<p>Presentation:</p>
<p>Alex Miller, the borough archivist, gave a presentation about his work regarding 
  the records kept at Leigh Town Hall, where records going back to 1185 are stored 
  and maintained. These records are growing is scope, particularly since the advent 
  of digital records, of which a massive amount is being generated. There has 
  been a big shift towards more public access. A guide to the archives is available 
  and the archives can be accessed online at http://www.wlct.org/Culture/Heritage/archives.htm</p>
<p>Alex passed around several interesting artefacts from the archives and reminded 
  us that volunteers to assist with the work of cataloguing are always welcome.</p>
<p>Greenheart Report:</p>
<p>Minutes of the meeting of the Greenheart Forum Group held on the 14th of April 
  will be made available on the website www.visitgreenheart.com/</p>
<p>With 70% of the borough being rural, this is a huge part of what Wigan has 
  to offer. British Waterways is to become a national charity and this might have 
  a significant impact on the North West and Greenheart. The idea is in consultation 
  stage and it is expected that Steve Broomhead will chair its NW division. Details 
  should be obtainable via the DEFRA website at www.defra.gov.uk/</p>
<p>Heritage Subgroup Report:</p>
<p>Carol Tyldesley reported and circulated minutes of the last meeting. The subgroup 
  is looking at capital projects concerning archaeology with Norman Redhead; principally 
  Ertherston Hall. The Haigh Windmill restoration should be open for viewing 1st 
  or 2nd weekend in May. Wigan is still a priority area as far as Heritage Lottery 
  is concerned and they are willing to support major funding bids. The next meeting 
  will be July 7th. </p>
<p>Members Reports:</p>
<p>Members were invited to email in any reports concerning their activities if 
  they would like them to be included in the minutes.</p>
<p>From Geoff Jones (Astley Green Colliery Museum):</p>
<p>Just at the moment we are suffering from what we regrettably call the 'Astley 
  Disease'. This is when any piece of moving equipment we want to use, we have 
  to fix before we use it. As you all probably appreciate, most of our plant equipment 
  is as old as some of our exhibits, and members come to think of it. Forward 
  movement on the railway extension has been, yet again, foiled by n 'immobile' 
  mobile crane and a fork lift truck battery charger that refuses to re-charge 
  the batteries. <br>
  As I mentioned at the meeting, we have also been re-visited by the metal thieves 
  and some considerable cost has been expended in more cameras and proximity lighting. 
  <br>
  Hopefully once the crane and battery charger are repaired we can then continue 
  with the railway extension.<br>
  The Headgear Structural Survey request for funding from Viridor has currently 
  stalled due to a lack of appreciation of what we are trying to achieve by Viridor 
  in Taunton, their headquarters, but other avenues for funding are also being 
  explored to clear the impasse.<br>
  School visits are about to start and also our outreach activities, several of 
  which have already been booked. <br>
  Meanwhile our external exhibits are progressively being painted and we hosted 
  a successful Stationary Engine Society Rally on Sunday 17th April. Two motorcycle 
  groups are also to have their rallies here this year.<br>
  Our biggest event has been to run the giant Winding Engine on the first Sunday 
  in April. This was restricted to supportive members, but from now on each First 
  Sunday in the month at 2pm the event will be repeated. We will keep it low key 
  this year, as the Engine is 100 years old next year and it is the centenary 
  of full production being achieved at the mine. Hopefully we will have a community 
  Gala with the media and dignitaries present. The First Sunday in the Month has 
  been deliberately chosen to give visitors the opportunity to see the Engine 
  in operation and then visit other nearby sites in a similar vein e.g. Eland 
  Road Mill, Bolton Steam Museum, and Trencherfield Mill etc.</p>
<p><br>
  Any Other Business:</p>
<p>Jan Johnson has put up a number of video clips on YouTube concerning intergeneration 
  events and is considering organising a nostalgia day soon. This idea might fit 
  with Heritage Open Days and are hoping that for the Civic Hall in Lowton will 
  be venue for the event. Geoff Jones is happy to provide a slide show for that 
  occasion.</p>
<p>Next Meeting To be held on the 6th June and will also be the AGM. <br>
