  Minutes of the last meeting (19th September): Accepted as a true record.</p>
<p>Matters Arising: None arising from September meeting. No minutes from last 
  two meetings - the visit to Damhouse and the awards presentation event. </p>
<p>Presentation of Asset Transfer by Lynn Calderbank (officer responsible).</p>
<p>Lynn gave a comprehensive description of Council&#146;s current position regarding 
  asset transfer to community groups and individuals, with details of several 
  specific instances, which illustrate how each application needs to be considered 
  in isolation. One cap does not fit all. She outlined the process whereby applications 
  are considered for approval or otherwise, various funding opportunities and 
  her own role in providing support for applicants. She answered specific questions 
  for network members and responded to general comments</p>
<p>More details of asset transfer are available at https://www.wigan.gov.uk/Council/Strategies-Plans-and-Policies/Community-asset-transfer.aspx</p>
<p>Lynn offered to attend future network meetings and was warmly thanked by the 
  chair for her valuable contribution to the meeting.</p>
<p>Greenslate Community Farm:</p>
<p>The E&amp;H Network is a member/shareholder of Greenslate Community Farm. An 
  organisation can nominate one of its members to represent the organisation at 
  the Community Farm AGM. It was decided that Joe Taylor is authorised to represent 
  E&amp;H Network at the Greenslate Community Farm AGM and other general meetings 
  of that organisation.</p>
<p>Planning for 2017:</p>
<p>Looking ahead to the upcoming year it was decided that meetings will be held 
  6th March, 22nd May, 3rd July (a visit to a yet to be determined venue), 14th 
  August, 25th September, 6th November and 18th December (awards day).</p>
<p>It was decided that we will try to get a speaker for meetings and John suggested 
  a number of possibilities. We have a speaker arranged for the next meeting. 
  John will try to arrange speakers for subsequent meetings. He also recommended 
  we look at www.communitybook.org</p>

  NW IN BLOOM, Special Achievement from WMBC and Wigan &amp; Leigh Homes, Best 
  Community Group.</p>
<p>ATHERTON PARK<br>
  The volunteer group have done an excellent job in the Central Park.</p>
<p>LIBRARY<br>
  See note circulated. </p>
<p>ENA MILL<br>
  The plans for the expansion of facilities at the mill have been accepted. This 
  consists of housing and heritage centre at the existing retail outlet.</p>
<p>COMMUNITY HALLS<br>
  Despite vigorous protests from residents WMBC have approved plans to demolish 
  Formby Hall in Atherton and Lowton Civic Hall</p>
<p>LOCAL BUS SERVICES<br>
  The re-scheduling and routing of buses between Atherton and Wigan means that 
  journey times can be an hour or more, this is extremely frustrating for residents. 
</p>
