Minutes of last meeting - true and accurate<br>
Matters arising - none.<br>
Presentation:<br>
Mandy Wellens-Bray, a Network member from Rebel Flower Farm, gave an apt presentation, 
in view of Wigan Council declaring a climate emergency, regarding Regenerative 
Agriculture. <br>
Scientific knowledge about how farming has degraded soil, causing carbon dioxide 
to be released into the atmosphere instead of being absorbed into the soil, is 
a fairly recent development. Modern farming methods cause a negative feedback 
loop, destroying the soil&#146;s ability to produce the nutrients all life depends 
on. The carbon dioxide released by chemical based agriculture is causing the sea 
to turn acidic and climate change as we understand it today.<br>
This topic proved to be of interest to attending members and the chair allowed 
discussion to continue beyond the time usually allocated to presentations.<br>
It was agreed that the E&amp;H Network will arrange a visit to Rebel Flower Farm 
early next year.<br>
Members Reports: <br>
Mary gave out copies of the latest Archaeology Society newsletters.<br>
Next Meeting 9th December - Presentation Day - Discovery Room 10.30.
