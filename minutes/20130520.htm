  Interpreting Our Environment and Heritage Story </p>
<p>John O'Neill talked about his meeting with Richard Sivill and Peter Goodwin 
  on 19th March where they discussed the idea of bringing together information 
  about the heritage and environment of individual local areas - People, Places 
  and Things in Your Area. Standish had produced something along these lines previously 
  - '50 things you didn't know about Standish'. John suggested that branch libraries 
  might consider displaying information about the history of their area as a form 
  of 'mini-archive'. Heritage Lottery Fund have their new scheme 'Sharing Heritage' 
  with grants from &pound;3K- &pound;10K.</p>
<p>John met with Alex Miller and Wigan Council Communications Team to discuss 
  the idea of doing one area as a pilot. They suggested Wigan Flashes. They are 
  keen to promote the area as they hope to establish a visitor centre with money 
  from a housing development nearby. They are looking to involve partners in the 
  promotion of Wigan Flashes.</p>
<p>Ken Barston mentioned that Ashton/Bryn partnership had obtained &pound;10K 
  to do a project with 'Mobile Media Partnership' based at Salford Quays. The 
  project would compile stories, record theme on audio and lend audio machines 
  to people to hear the stories.</p>
<p>John mentioned that The Friends of Low Hall have produced some good publicity 
  material around the history of Low Hall manor house and the flora and fauna 
  of the site.</p>
<p>John also spoke about the idea of doing a follow-up DVD to 'Our Heritage' featuring 
  10 new stories - possibly ones from the original list of suggestions that didn't 
  make it onto the first DVD. John circulated the original proposal paper from 
  Peter in 2010 to remind people of these ideas. Richard Sivill mentioned cotton 
  mills and in particular Howe Bridge Mill and Ena Mill in Atherton. Richard knows 
  the last two managers of Howe Bridge Mill.</p>
<p><br>
  Any Other Business - none.</p>
