<p>Avis Freeman chaired the meeting and welcomed everyone present.</p>
<p>Minutes of Last Meeting: The deadline for the essay competition was given as 
  December 1st but it should be October 3rs, otherwise true and accurate.</p>
<p>Matters Arising:</p>
<p>None</p>
<p>Possibilities Regarding the Community Investment Fund:</p>
<p>There was a long discussion regarding the role of the Network since the abandonment 
  of the Local Area Agreement system and the priority for the wider public to 
  engage in service provision as a result of the cuts to Council's budget by central 
  government.</p>
<p>There is an article regarding the CIF in the current issue of Borough Life 
  (pages 24 - 25) although some areas have not received a copy yet.</p>
<p>Glenys reported that Trust In Leigh, one of the successful applicants to last 
  year's CIF, intend giving support to community groups, initially in Leigh but 
  perhaps eventually extending to cover the Borough. There is a meeting on the 
  16th of May from 12.30 to 2.00 for interested parties. It would appear that 
  Trust In Leigh is attempting to replace some of the services previously provided 
  by CVS.</p>
<p>Ken said that the Network should not be regarded as barrier for any other organisation 
  operating within the Borough.</p>
<p>Kath pointed out that the reduction in council's budget means that Council 
  will be more reliant on community support, which should strengthen the community's 
  hand in negotiating with Council. </p>
<p>Alex sees no reason why the Network shouldn't be able to help shape policy 
  regarding heritage and the environment.</p>
<p>Peter underlined the fact that the role for the Network in the governance structure 
  no longer exists and therefore the Network is unable to perform one of the main 
  functions it was established to provide.</p>
<p>John commented that In addition to being part of the governance structure, 
  the Network's remit is to be an umbrella organisation to support and encourage 
  individuals and groups involved with heritage and environmental issues. One 
  of many ways we do that is by formally thanking those engaged at the presentation 
  evening. </p>
<p>Health is a priority for Wigan Borough. Statistics show we are below the national 
  average. The Network contributes to Health indirectly in many ways but perhaps 
  could focus more in that particular regard.</p>
<p>The question remains, should the Network henceforth focus on providing a service 
  to Council, in light of present circumstances, or should the Network continue 
  as before, as an umbrella group for those engaged in Heritage and Environmental 
  issues.</p>
<p>Avis suggested that we invite James Winterbottom to the next meeting for further 
  clarification and advice.</p>
<p>Due to the length of this discussion, there was no time for Members Reports 
  or AOB</p>
<p>Date &amp; Time Next Two Meetings: </p>
<p>The next two meetings will be June 16th, Museum of Wigan Life, subject to confirmation 
  and July 14th Greenslate Community Farm.</p>
