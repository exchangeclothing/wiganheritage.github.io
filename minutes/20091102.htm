<p>Carol Watson gave a brief overview of the proposed 'Electoral College' methodology 
  to select community representatives to the many positions now required by the 
  restructure of the LSP architecture and answered questions arising.</p>
<p>Minutes of the last meeting-true and accurate, passed</p>
<p>Matters arising: </p>
<p>The &pound;3000 from Awards for All, to help found groups, was discussed. It 
  was decided that &pound;300 should go to the Environment &amp; Heritage Network 
  and that &pound;150 of this would go to Tudor House towards meeting venue rental. 
  &pound;300 each should go to Billinge &amp; Orrell Transition Group, Billinge 
  &amp; Orrell Allotment &amp; Gardening Association and Town Green Residents 
  Association. It was agreed that &pound;800 should go to the Discovery Group, 
  in part to assist with the purchase of equipment. It was decided that, should 
  no more groups form before the next meeting, we should consider how best the 
  surplus might be distributed among the existing groups for training and equipment.</p>
<p>The DVD we received funding to produce is finished. Resource packs are being 
  printed then copies of the DVD and resource pack will go to18 schools in the 
  borough. It was agreed that the &pound;3,000 balance outstanding to Mirabilis 
  Media be paid on receipt of the invoice. </p>
<p>John O'Neill reported on the painting 'Going North' by George Earl that hangs 
  in the Council Chambers. It might be better displayed where the public have 
  better access to it.</p>
<p>John had attended the follow-up meeting with the management of the Grand Arcade 
  about the Roman display. Two booklets are planned, one for adults a one for 
  children. Attempts are being made to come to an arrangement regarding the printing 
  of these booklets.</p>
<p>Wigan Borough in Bloom held a Big Thank You event. Lots of people across the 
  borough are now involved and from network members Subshaw Cross and Foundry 
  were recognised for their outstanding projects. The latter was also successful 
  for North West in Bloom. Lots or people across the borough are now involved 
  in various aspects of the scheme and local groups are encouraged to participate. 
</p>
<p>New Planning Proposals Related to Heritage:</p>
<p>The government has issued new proposed guidelines for councils about how they 
  can use 'historic assets'. The new policy claims to be about 'protecting the 
  historic, environment, archaeological sites, historic areas etc.' whilst sending 
  a clear message that 'the historic environment should be seen as an asset not 
  an obstacle to development'. Though it will make the process easier to understand, 
  there's a real danger that it will make it easier for developers to get their 
  way. The chair has written to the planning department re our concerns and requested 
  that we, as a Network, be consulted on all matters concerning heritage.</p>
<p>The OnSide North West Charity proposed application regarding the Mesnes Playing 
  Field (the old Wigan Grammar cricket ground) is a case in question for a &pound;6.5 
  million sate-of -the-art youth centre to be built on land that was left to the 
  borough for open space. The Network and Civic Trust have expressed their concerns 
  about this proposal</p>
<p>The New Council Committee System:</p>
<p>From May 2009, changes were made in the way the council's committee system 
  works. Scrutiny committees consisting of 15 councillors, plus the chair, will 
  scrutinise the performance of the new Thematic Partnership blocks. The block 
  that concerns us is the Economic, Environment, Culture &amp; Housing Block (EECH). 
  The chair has written to the officer in charge to ask that we be informed when 
  anything relating to environment and heritage comes up on the agenda and that 
  we are sent a copy of the annual work plan.</p>
<p>Network Visits to Environment &amp; Heritage Sites:</p>
<p>It was agreed that members should visit Astley Green Colliery Museum November 
  16, starting 10.00. The tour will take about two and a half hours. For further 
  information call 01942 708969. </p>
<p>Suggestions for other sites to visit in the future included Howe Green Village 
  and the Bickershaw site.</p>
<p>A Bickershaw site visit would be best arranged for late June/early July and 
  would be designed as a multi-interest event - e.g. looking at two small flashes 
  of different ages and noting their evolving flora and fauna; crossing bare pit 
  dirt and seeing the early examples of emerging plant life and the effects of 
  water erosion (giving a mini-lesson on how rivers evolve); and ending the visit 
  on top of the ruck, again noting how different soil types accommodate diverse 
  plant and animal communities. </p>
<p>Members Reports: (some given verbally - these below given digitally)<br>
  <br>
  Wigan Archaeological Society:</p>
<p>Excavation continues at the Rectory in Wigan. Mid-Victorian garden features 
  have been found in one area of the site and we hope that below these will be 
  the remains of the original Frog Lane, which could date from the medieval period. 
  A watching brief is being carried out at All Saints Churchyard whilst the flagged 
  pathways by the church and war memorial are being re-laid. Members are also 
  involved in building surveys and recording the remaining milestones, guide stones 
  and earlier metal indicators in the local area.</p>
<p>Astley Green Colliery Museum:</p>
<p>2009 has been a very busy year for the Museum. We have had 29 group visits 
  and outreach presentations to a varied selection of people. This includes French 
  and Danish organisations. Next year appears to be continuing in the same vein 
  as 61 students and teachers are to visit in April. Our web site<br>
  www.agcm.org.uk has certainly helped to make the site visible to the world! 
</p>
<p>Our narrow gauge railway extension is currently awaiting acceptance from Her 
  Majesty's Railway Inspectorate re approval of a level crossing. We can then 
  clear the conditions on the associated planning approval and start to build 
  the railway.</p>
<p>Funding to enable a structural survey to be conducted on the mine headgear 
  is being sought and once completed it is hoped that the results can be used 
  to seek further funding for its restoration.</p>
<p>We have recently had visits from scrap metal thieves and the police now include 
  the site on their patrols.</p>
<p>Conservation and preservation work continues on the site including the former 
  Steam Winding Engine, the results of which will be available to view for those 
  who visit on the 16th November.</p>
<p>An educational related Lottery Bid is currently on hold due to current lack 
  of space to relocate equipment in one of the required existing rooms. Museum 
  re-accreditation status is also proving to be a slow process.</p>
<p>Discovery Group:</p>
<p>Are active in Mesnes Park investigating the Ram Pump installation and the Depot 
  plant Nurseries. Plan to continue with search for the Manchester to Wigan Roman 
  Road until end of next year.</p>
<p>Billinge History/Heritage: </p>
<p>'The Billingers', re-printed as a joint venture with the author, the Society 
  and our Network, is back from the publishers. Launch days have been arranged 
  at several libraries over the week commencing November 16th. A percentage of 
  the profits will go the make Environment &amp; Heritage Network sustainable. 
  The retail price will be &pound;15. It was agreed that any Network member purchasing 
  a box of 9 copies could have them at a discounted price of &pound;10 per copy 
  - &pound;90 per box.<br>
  Conservation Department:<br>

  There is currently a Building Preservation Notice on the property protecting 
  it from any unauthorised works, including demolition for a 6-month period (expires 
  early March 2009). A listing application is with English Heritage who will assess 
  the building and decide whether it fulfils listing criteria. The application 
  for listing was submitted 2 weeks ago and the Council are awaiting a decision.<br>
  (2) Haigh Windmill, Haigh <br>
  The Windmill has recently received a grant of &pound;50,000 for works/repairs 
  to the windmill at Haigh. There is a site meeting at the Windmill this Thursday 
  at 10am (5th November) and all invited (Civic Trust, W&amp;LHT, etc). A subsequent 
  press release will be issued re the grant funding.<br>
  Leigh &amp; District Family History Society: <br>
  The society continues with their monthly meetings when attendance is usually 
  about 40. The Christmas Meeting will be a little different with a Session of 
  Sea Shanties by Kevin Brogen. Tickets available to cover the buffet at &pound;4.00 
  each. The Monday Workshop Session continue at the Local History Section of Leigh 
  Library usually dealing with about 4 or 5 enquirers, some of whom have travelled 
  from as far away as Staffordshire.</p>
<p>Volunteers continue to add to the www.lancashirebmd.org.uk website, the indexes 
  of births, marriages and deaths at the local Register Office and the website 
  has now reached the 11 million entries mark.<br>
  Any Other Business:<br>
  The secretary spoke briefly about a new regional network for community activist 
  that is being developed to support those active in the community, such as us.
